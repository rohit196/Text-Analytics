Teenagers can safely venture out on their own and explore the other facilities within the compound.  Front gate security seemed first class, so we felt safe and secure. 

Guests can also book restaurants and meals in the other ""Palace"" properties in Cancun and area (with some restrictions), so there is an opportunity to get offsite while still having meals and amenities included without additional cost.

Food was good to excellent with a couple of minor exceptions.  We had some favorite restaurants that we revisited.

We were at the resort through hurricane Beryl which reached the coast about 150 miles to the south of us.  There were some interruptions to food and housekeeping service for a couple of days as workers were not able to get to work, but the facilities seem built to handle those conditions and there were not any major problems visible.

Other than some issues with local offsite vendors (scams) our visit to Mexico was good and we would definitely return to Moon Palace.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Dining selection: the food in every restaurants is so cheap, and nesty. There is no selection of fish stake or grill chicken ....people who.is on meducal diet or just ckean diet has nothing there to eat. 
Buffer was hiding a bacon.  They keep it in the kitchen stating that people eat a lot of bacon and if you want you have to request...what????

We asked for simple foods like rice pudding and jello, the rice pudding was not ready when we arrived and jello was not available. When they finally made it, they made a puree.

We traveled as a family and there was tons of activities for my children who widely vary in age (18, 14, 6), from entertaining shows, play areas, pools and gaming center. The restaurants were plentiful, we didn’t get a chance to experience them all however the ones we did eat at were really good (except for the Italian one). The hotel rooms were clean and the beds were soft. They’re not super new but good enough to sleep and stay comfortably. If you’re a beach person, the Sunrise isn’t for you. Try the Beach Palace or Grande as there are better beaches/sands on that end. The Sunrise beach was full of seaweed. Also, one area of feedback is the welcoming staff as they were really aggressive about the “promotion” to visit the Grande Palace. It was overwhelming, and they even called our hotel room over 3 times trying to sell an experience to visit the new resort. Outside of that, we had a wonderful time and we will be returning to experience the other palaces!

The third floor of the Sandia building had no elevators, and the table was dirty. The room was run-down and a motel 6 would have been better. We had previously stayed at Beach Palace 10 years ago, which was a much better experience. Unfortunately, this stay was not worth the money we paid. We upgraded to the Grand, but there was no vacancy until Saturday, and we had to pay an extra $300 per night. I came to the room for a shower, but I got locked out of the restroom and had to wait for maintenance. I ordered drinks three times, and they finally arrived at 9:45 PM. Our first order was placed shortly after we checked in at 5:00 PM. Found out later max beer limit in fridge is 6 total. The building was in disrepair, and we felt a drop of water fall from the ceiling when we checked in. The guy at the front desk joked that it was tequila, but it was not funny. Be aware if you book through Expedia, as this may be why we had such a poor experience. Holes on the bed sheets as well. No ventilation or AC in bathroom so you have to share the lovely smell all throughout the room. 8/3 Update on upgrade waited all day around the grand to finally get our room received and email a little after 1800 there was no clear communication that we would need to check out of Sunrise prior to moving so here we are waiting another hour or more to go back check out and come get back in line.

Kids are 3 and 7 years old. The service and staff were excellent! Always friendly and helpful. So many things to do for all ages. Our boys loved the Wired arcade lounge and the pool/ waterpark of course! 

Be warned, they will convince you to attend a presentation for their Palaxe Membership. For your attendance, they offered us 2 day passes to The GRand side which has more restaurants and the waterpRark. Shuttles between resorts a ground golf carts are very convenient. 

Salespeople are brutal though. Do yourself a favor and set a timer for 90mins, the maximum time limit for the presentation. Then Leave; as they will continue with 3 additional people to convince you to buy some sort of membership or return trip and package. 

The beach was not accessible with all the sea grass/weed piled up 5 ft high. Not the area for you if you want clear waters. Everything down the Riviera Maya in the summer months is all seaweed/grass beach. Next time, we will try and different resort for this reason. But other than that, a good “first time family “ all inclusive experience

They told me I had to contact Expedia, when I did, Expedia tried to tell me there was a higher hotel rate and I would have to pay the difference. Needless to say I hung up on Expedia…the hotel found the discrepancy (hotel’s fault) and was able to get us into a room. This process took well over an hour which I don’t believe is an acceptable time to wait to be checked in. Furthermore the $120 VIP credit is very limited, You can’t even use it to buy a $12 small bag of Doritos. Lastly, you will be asked if you want to attend a “90-min talk” that includes breakfast and  $300 credit…they will tell you it’s not a timeshare sales pitch, which is partially correct. It’s a 3  hour time spent that isn’t terrible, but way too long and of course it’s a sales pitch to join something similar to a time share. The $300 credit was an ordeal that we had to spend extra time to have it credited during check out. Finally, the staff was nice and professional, the restaurants were good. We did enjoy our time, but this vacation would have been so much better if the check-in/out process was improved. Make sure you check your room charges, there was a charge of over $250 that was ‘accidentally’ added. ",,,,,,,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Transportation: Golf cart didn’t really go around our area that often. Most of the time we had to walk to the lobby. We stayed in Sunrise, Sun building. 
They tried to sell us the member 110k, 55k, then 19k for the packages. We didn’t buy. They gave us $750 resort credits for massage. We made the appt but they cancelled us. We didn’t know about it until we showed up. Mainly it’s not free, we still have to pay $82   tips for 2 couple massage which wasn’t bad. The bad part it they made us feel like it’s FREE.

I pulled up Expedia and their rate was the same I was paying - the hotel REFUSED to honor the Expedia rate while I was standing in their lobby...so I had to book another one night reservation through Expedia for the better rate.

Thankful for Expedia - they truly came through and saved us hundreds of dollars for an extra night when Moon Palace was NOT WILLING to help us at all.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, amenities, property conditions & facilities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Staff & service","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

It was our first time staying there. We read the reviews and were very excited. It was a total disappointment since we arrived. The place is unkept, old and dirty. Dead plants on the entrance tables, dirty cups all over. They sent us to the Expedia line. They did not treat us as a VIP Expedia member. No complimentary upgrades or views. However, if you paid extra they were able to upgrade you. The person who helped us was annoyed and in a bad mood which brought our morale down. We arrive to our room and our room was old nothing like the pictures online. The toilet didn’t flush properly and had a perticular smell. It’s an old resort that can really use some remodeling. The pool water was so dirty it was cloudy. It had trash floating around the pool such as wrappers, straws and food. The staff was walking around with no care in the world instead of cleaning it. The food and drinks were good. The resort was so bad we only stayed one night. We had to upgrade to the grand moon palace. Of course we had to pay an additional fee. The grand is a lot nicer, newer and cleaner than the sunrise. I will never stay at the sunrise again. The grand resort has good restaurants and drinks. The staff is very friendly and nice. Total opposite from the sunrise. The beach water is not clear and has a lot of sea weed. We had to drive to the Palace beach to get into the beach. The beach there is nice and clear.

Timeshare / ""membership"" upsell is omnipresent.  Restaurant service was all over the board - some were very quick, and others were slowly - like 45  minutes to get entrees.  Bar service was likewise variable - sometimes it was fast, and other times it was just excruciatingly slow.
Lots of slipper surfaces after the rain, which is most days in Cancun.
Coconut ice cream was *fantastic* though.  Resort is gigantic - like 2 miles end to end on Google Maps.

Jesus at the Sunrise side main pool area was amazingly fun and competent. He made each day fun. 

Bad: the shows each night are very fun. But most shows have a dinner in the area prior to the show so you have no way to sit and actually watch the show when you get there. This frustrated a LOT of people. Scratch the pre-dinner if you’re promoting a show you want people to attend. Give them a place to sit.

If it is your first time, it is a decent cheaper option. Having been to a few other resorts, we really missed the bright blue water as this resort didn’t have it so no one spent time at the beach. Great participation in the pool activities and nightly entertainment was active/decent.

The staff were slow and not cooperative, they did nothing much to facilitate you. The staff did not explain things well and twice someone (a male staff member) entered my room without knocking, the first time it was at 8 am and woke us up and the second time it was around 9:40 and we were getting ready to go to breakfast and he saw my sister and i naked, when we told the staff they just said that they were sorry for the inconvenience. It is a shame that i have to leave with this horrible experience. The hotel was not as clean as it should be, there was mold in the bathroom floor, hair on the bathroom wall and the jacuzzi also had mold. The mini bar was rarely refilled even when we requested it, and when they would come it was several hours later, when we requested water it arrived 6 hours later and it was a personal water bottle, additionally, when i tried calling room service they never answered on all 4 occasions. Also, they advertised a resort with a beautiful view of the sea which when we arrived the sea was not as advertised, the one in the pictures of the expedia site was turquoise water instead of the muddy, dull sea that we saw. I do not recommend this hotel and i wish i had stayed at any of the previous hotels that i have visited or a completely different one instead of this disappointed of a hotel.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

The air conditioning is not cold enough in tooms and throughout the central buildings. The rooms are noisy. You can hear everyone walking past rooms, yelling, kids running all hours of night. Big turn off is the resort constantly badgers you to sit through a presentation to sell you on their more expensive property (the Grand). They call your room multiple times a day including early morning and even at check out try to sell you a ""discounted"" future vacation package. It was a constant sales pitch our entire stay. This reason alone is why we would never come back to this resort.

Very clean . Mostly friendly staff. Except one experience with golf cart driver who was very rude. 
Struggled with food options though. If I have not attended whole membership selling presentation for grand palace, I do not think so we would had many good food options.  Sunrise it self does not have good food options. For some reason out of our 5 day stay- Gandola that had the good food was closed 2 days ☹️☹️☹️
And the other buffet was over crowded even in the off season.

But the service was by far the best at sunrise, the staff was always amazing , great vibes and entertainment every night at the lobby. 

Room service and pool side service was great. However the room service cleanup was always very delayed, we had animals go through the leftovers every night. 

Kids club at the sunrise and nizuc was amazing! My 5 year old daughter loved going there daily, she had such a great time. He received daily paints from the staff, they were great with her!

Only bad comment about the resort was the moon palace membership, they really press hard for you to check out the grande and their membership. They say it’s not a timeshare, basically is! We got suckered in and wasted 3 hours when we were promised 90 max. They gave us 2 days pass to the grande. DO NOT GET SUCKERED IN. 

The grande water park passes are it worth it. The food and service was horrible. Took 2 hours for poolside service at the water park. The food was rubbery and dry. Ordered drinks and they didn’t arrive after over an hour so we left. We went to the buffet, my husband is celiac and they didn’t take it seriously whatsoever unlike the sunrise side. He actually go my very sick rom the gluten in the food. EXTREMELY disappointed with the grand. So glad we didn’t pay for the water park passes. 

The food and service is horrible!!! Their breakfast buffet was terrible too. Service was worst.

There was a large number of staff, which were all friendly and helpful. 

The only thing that I would have preferred was more access to sunscreen. We brought sunscreen with us, but ran out and had to buy an incredibly expensive bottle.

Every staff member was outstanding and did their best to keep everyone happy.  The issue was not with staff or facility, but the ability of the resort to handle the large amount of customers.  We stayed during spring break, and we understood that it would be busy.  However, they should have made sure everyone had the opportunity to make a reservation at one of the restaurants (which required reservation).  By the time we checked in, there were no open spots on any of the restaurants for the duration of our stay.  Also, they need to patrol the pool chairs a little better.  I was apalled by how people ""reserved"" their chair very early in the morning, and never used it during the day. All they needed to do was to put a towel on it.  Our family had to sit at the edge of the pool and wait until late afternoon until someone left to get a lounge chair.  They need a better system so everyone can get their fair share of what the resort has to offer.  For this reason, I will not be returning to this hotel.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Friend recommended. Frequent visitors to Cancun/Riviera Maya/Playa Del Carmen areas.
Let’s just say that had we not gone thru the experience we had, I would have rated 5 stars. Reviewing best to bad. 
The hotel grounds, beach, and views were amazing. Moon Palace property was huge but they maintained it very well & offered cart service throughout. Their transportation service was quick & we were off to the hotel within 5 min upon meeting the driver.  At check in, we were told we were VIP guests & given $120 room credit since we booked with Expedia (assuming Expedia has partnership with this hotel group). Palace Resorts has a free app & it’s actually very good & easy to use. Rooms were clean & well stocked with the standard essentials & goodies. We have stayed at better rooms (design, size, & overall ambiance) at other hotels. They have many restaurants that cater to all appetites. The food I would rate 7 out of 10 however we ate mainly at the buffet restaurants due to convenience. Now for the bad. As mentioned, we were given store credit which ended up being a sham. The credits were not applied to what we bought & the store doesn’t even label what can/can’t be used for store credit.
Final/main issue was that they entered our room unauthorized while we were at dinner despite a do not disturb sign at our door & took our wet money that we left to dry out. Hotel unbothered to compensate the cash/store credit after complaint",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Staff & service","",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s huge, you have to take a golf cart ride most places to get there in a reasonable amount of time. We had to wait for dinner most nights unless we ate at the buffets, often times 1-2 hours. When dining, service often took too long to get even our drinks. However, the wait staff along with the staff around the resort was always friendly and kind. For the size of the resort, I would say that they don’t have enough restaurant seating capacity. The food was decent but we’ve had better at other resorts. They had plenty of activities for children which was nice. The spa was good. The app is really nice for finding information, asking questions and booking reservations and spa appts. We likely won’t return but there are plenty of people who enjoy this resort. ",,,,,,,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

The only problem I see and I want to emphasize is their luring of guests to “presentation” and trying to forcefully make you buy their “membership”! Memberships range from $110k to a million.. 
Give me a break! Tell us the offer and send us emails maybe we will sign up if we like it! But NO! They wanted right away! We flew all the way just to waste our whole 1 day (Saturday)!! Stop making guests go through this whole “presentation” thing, “Grand hotel” “Water park” thing and “Why you buy through Expedia?” crap! Expedia should ban them instead!!

Because of the creepy practice and false advertisement with all the employees (who were wearing green uniforms, black and white suited robots whose only job is to make you sign for membership; if you don’t they stare at you!), we won’t be coming back to Moon Palace!

Just resort itself is great - great food, great service, great entertainment both kids and shows, great location (besides dirty ocean - reefs). Everything was good!

The room was overall nice looking but I think the building we were in (Sandia) had some plumbing problems. The hallways on the 3rd floor were often wet and the room and some areas around a few buildings sometimes smelled like sewage.

The service was overall very good. I liked the bars esp the main lobby. Their tequilas were premium.

There are a couple of restaurents at the maim building which were all good esp.  the Indian and Tepanyaki. There are some other nice restaurents which are further away and need a shuttle ride which is not very frequent. Overall I recommend this resort but I think I overpaid by at least a couple of grands.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children","Traveled with group","Traveled with family",

The staff was attentive, the dining options varied, and the facilities impressive, creating a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere.However, disappointments arose with external services. A notable issue was our late pickup for an Isla Mujeres tour, followed by an unexpected overcharge for a golf cart rental on the island. Charged $100, I later found similar rentals for half the price, raising concerns about overpaying.Departure also brought frustration. Despite assurances from the hotel that taxi payment to the airport could be made by card, the driver informed us at the airport he couldn't accept cards, leading to a last-minute rush to find an ATM.Additionally, the hotel's USD credits were very limited in use, diminishing the value of what could have been a beneficial perk.While the hotel shines in service, dining, and amenities, it falls short in managing external services and transparent pricing. Guests should be wary of potential extra costs and confirm details to avoid similar inconveniences. Improvements in these areas could significantly enhance the overall guest experience.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, property conditions & facilities, room comfort",,,,,"A Stay of Highs and Lows",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Oscar did a good job with checking on us throughout the trip.    Rooms were clean but too small for 2 adults and 2 older children.  Room location was perfect, we were in the Chile building.  Right after check in they get you to try and do the timeshare tour which was not worth it for us, it was 2 1/2 hours long and they wouldn’t take no for an answer.  Francisco at the swim up bar was amazing and always had a smile on his face!  You can’t get anything with the resort credits so that was kind of a joke.  Also when we were checking out we got approached by someone else to try and get another package for next year and she would not take no for an answer as well.  The food was pretty good, the service at the restaurants were great! Overall, I would give it about 7.5/10.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Their time share expired so we were looking for somewhere new to try.  

We had a quick 4 day window for a getaway with the kids and we chose Moon Palace Sunrise for a few reasons.  Vicinity to the airport, good reviews, value and the many food options.

We arrived and the check in process was quick and our room requests were met.  We quickly scurried to our room to get ready to swim for a bit.  We had dinner at the buffet the first evening and we were left a little less than impressed with that meal but every meal and I mean EVERY meal after that exceeded our expectations.

The only thing that I would share is that the lunch options near the pool do not open until noon.  We are early risers so breakfast is usually at 8:30 for us and we don't like eating large breakfasts.  It would be nice if they opened for lunch at 11 or atleast 11:30 because we usually swim around 9:30 and the kids as well as the adults are typically very hungry, borderline hangry by noon.

Overall it is a great resort and we will be back again for a week in the near future.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

But expect room service to take 2 hours at times, it could be due to how busy they are but when you ask for an update they say 5 mins and it takes longer. We stayed in the melon block of rooms and the water had an interesting smell, not sure if it’s the whole resort or just that block.

Overall it was a good experience, besides the 1-2 things I would definitely recommend this property. It’s only 10 minutes from the airport, there’s tons of facilities at the resort, staff are welcoming. 

I would also recommend booking excursions directly though the resort, we took a trip to chichen itza and it was definitely one of the best parts of the trip",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Amenities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

The servers at the bars and restaurants are phenomenally nice, however the other staff is terribly rude. We had a number of problems that no one took responsibility for and we were sent in circles from department to department. An absolute waste of time and they’re all employed by the same place so why can’t someone solve it. 

Trying to leave today we had already checked out, but the bell boy in front was incredibly rude telling us we needed a particular piece of paper that wasn’t given to us. He physically wouldn’t let us leave and was very aggressive.  Another prolonged wait and nearly missing our transport to the airport we finally we allowed to leave.

-Property is overcrowded 
-Restaurants are always closed 
-Rooms are very shallow and you can hear everything outside

Two things up front, I travel a lot and this is not my 1st stay at Moon Palace.  It will be my last though.  I would not recommend this property to anyone.  

Some of the Bad:
Whether this was Expedia's fault or the hotel, the hotel should have done more.  I was charged an additional almost 2 thousand at check-in for changing a 15 year old to an 18 year old.  When I made the reservation I specified that I didn't know who would be able to go.  Told no problem, booked the room, site says all person on property are considered adults, so I thought no problem. Well, they made me pay for an extra person in my room.  Front desk manager said she would contact expedia and work something, but I never heard from her again. 

Hotel credit...It is not any type of hotel credit unless you purchase certain items.  Even one of the attendees admitted it was a scam.  In the store, you can only buy one specific set of tequila, which retails around $40, but it is $199 hotel credit.  We tried to use it to get a photo session done, after the pictures we intended to get the 10 photo package for $250 hoping to offset to $130 because we had $120 in hotel credit, but were not allowed.  The only thing we could do was buy the package for $250 and add 4 additional shots, but wait that wasn't even true, they wanted $30 more because the 4 additional shots which were $25 each required us to have $150 in credit.

Property looks clean however, there is constant sewage/standing water smell in public areas and in bathroom (likely from the drain). The dining options are VERY limited. The dining hall (Bugambilas and Gandola) seems to have same menu everyday and it is impossible to get reservation in their restaurants. We tried for 5 days but only got to eat at Momo after 1.5hr wait. Unlike other all-inclusives, Moon palace did not allow to make reservations prior to checkin so you cannot plan in advance either. Further, one of the managers at Momo (restaurant) cursed in front of my son not knowing that my son is bilingual and understands Spanish. When confronted, she mentioned that they are allowed to talk among themselves in bad language and she was not referring to us (although we feel she did). Disappointing to say the least!

The rooms are relatively small vs. other all-inclusive options we have stayed. They also have jetted-tub in the room (next to the beds) which takes up lot of space.

It seemed late-night entertainment options were limited. There was not much to do past 11pm unless you want to play pool at the Sky bar.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with group","Traveled with family",,

For example, you don't find out until your arrive that any of the restaurants that require a reservation require that they're made 24 hours in advance. So, we arrive and want to make a rez, but can't because they have to be made 24-hours in advance. Then we try and they're all booked for the next 3 nights! Meanwhile, when we finally do get a rez at one of them, we walk in and there are dozens of tables available. So clearly people make reservations and then 1.  never show up and 2. never cancel their rez letting other people have one. There was a lot of smoke and mirrors, basically. Also, the hallways where our room was so SO LOUD at night. People running up and down, screaming at the top of their lungs (it was midnight, not like 9pm), and people just slamming their room doors not caring about anyone else. This element of it was very disappointing. Our stay was 12/26-12/31 and on 12/29 they started doing construction on a stage for a NYE performance.

Once the administration staff of the Moon Palace realizes you are “not a member, not an owner” in “Palace vacations” and are not willing to invest to become an owner or member in “Palace vacations” they are no longer helpful. These antics felt dishonest and disingenuous.  The beach is not great at this location either. 
My family will not return to the Moon Palace for vacation. There are other resorts in Cancun that are respectful of your time on your family vacation and have nicer beaches.

The drinks were awful. Watered down. Filled with artificial sweeteners. I didn’t find a single tasty drink during my stay. And the amount of time and effort they spend trying to sell you on timeshares and other extras is absurd. I had a sales lady follow me around for a half an hour trying to sell me on additional stays that I very clearly told her I did not want. I could go on. My advice? Avoid this place at all costs unless you like throwing up in your bathroom at 2 in the morning.

The gentleman assisting us was pleasant, and we considered the possibility that he may have overlooked it, which was not a big concern.

The check-in process went smoothly and we got Room-6124 in NIZUC. However, upon entering our room, we encountered an issue with the TV not functioning. Despite multiple calls to the help desk, each time we received varying statements such as ""Technician coming,"" ""on the way,"" or ""2 mins away,"" but unfortunately, the TV was never repaired.

The need for an extra bed became another challenge, as we had to make at least six calls with the same response as the TV issue. At 10 pm, I observed a hotel personnel carrying two beds in our lobby.

Due to the TV not working and the absence of printed menus of the restaurants in room, which were typically displayed on the TV, we had to individually visit each restaurant, take pictures of the menus, and repeat this process for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The inconveniences with the TV and extra bed issues consumed much of our time, preventing us from booking excursions on the first day. We have to drive to destinations by own.

The staff was not very friendly and the sales agents were extremely pushy. The entertainment and venue were lacking. The Michael Jackson show was okay but I’ve seen better at other resorts.

 While there a man knocked over tables at the Bumgambilias restaurant after a discussion with staff; this could have been de-escalated by that same staff. Lastly, parents please watch over your kids. The lifeguards will not. A child almost drowned while we were there and the guards on watch were not paying attention. I would recommend booking at the Grand.

One was, that you hear the planes and room service carts.   We never heard any of that and we were on the 3rd floor.

The food especially was wonderful in every restaurant,  including room service. 
As our first true honeymoon and vacation in 14 years, I wanted my husband to experience the MP and the delicious food available there. 
I am now disabled and need a wheelchair for long walks.
The chair provided, while serviceable, was in very poor condition. 
After our VIP check-in, it took several calls which kept getting cut off, and about an hour hour and a half to get our luggage. Then at midnight, a bellboy, knocked on our door demanding to see all our luggage so he could take pictures of our arrival tags. He said they had lost another customers luggage, and because we had seven items they assumed it was given to us. 
This was all very inconvenient for us and he wouldn't take our word that we didn't have it. He made us feel like thieves. BTW, it was not in our room.
Room service food was complete garbage. Tastless, packaged premade food. Most of the food sent to us ended up back ìn the hallway. 
Almost every restaurant served food that was luke warm, and again most was obviously premade, and usually tasteless. The Gondola was particularly awful. One night two different main course meals were served to us. One bite was all it took to walk away. It was presented beautifully, however, they were cold, and the best way to describe their risotto is vomit. One bite to try each item was horrible.

Check-in took forever, because the staff didn't know how to do it. 

The room was not cleaned on the first two days and whenever we called the house keeping their response was ""too late, what do you want me to do"". 

The sellers were unbearable. They call at ALL times to offer the hotel promotions to come back. Very early in the morning too. 

Everyone is VERY rude. They act like they were doing you a favor. 

Reservations are very hard to get at all restaurants. 

Very bad service at bars because they want you to consume less, so it takes forever to a get a drink, or they prepare it poorly. 

Food is average. 

We were a group of 11 people, many separate reservations, we all had the same experience. 

There are some good things and they did have a couple (yes, 2) of people who were very nice. But for that price, you can find a much better deal.

We stayed at Nizuc and went to dinner twice at Sunrise. You can use all the amenities at both resorts. Sunrise seemed bigger and busier so it would depend what you want. We loved the towel service.  No card and no return policy. Thank goodness. And loved the room key on our bracelets.  Perfect!! Loved the basketball court and even tried tennis.  

Did not like the resort credits.  We had $120 per room. They are only for certain items so you have to check and the actual items are very limited. Also very difficult to make reservations to the more popular restaurants so you might want to start that process as soon as you arrive.  

We spent most of our days at the beach and in the ocean.  Ocean was like a bath but ‘a bit’ of seaweed which made the water dark. Pool was a bit busy with kids and noisy. 

Staff were very friendly and fun.  I did water aerobics with Kevin.  Very fun. 

Overall decent resort and nice rooms.  ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Definitely some visible gunk in the showers, kinda gross.

Walls are thin and you can hear the noisy halls and voices echoing. They need to invest in rubber wheels for their push carts! Those carts are INCREDIBLY loud. Since it's 24/7 room service, be ready to be woken up in the middle of the night by a loud cart rolling past your door.

The reservation-only restaurants have great service and very good food.

Buffets aren't bad either, but expect poor service (for example, offering a group of 7 people the smallest table meant for 2, when most of the restaurant was practically empty).

Nobody mentions that the hotel is directly below a flight path. Hope you like the sound of jet engines every few minutes!

There are ""elite membership"" only lounge chairs by the beach, but there is NO signage. Expect to get rudely kicked off chairs by staff. Again, there are no signs indicating which seats are reserved for elite members... so good luck!

Service overall is generally poor compared to resorts we've visited in Costa Rica and Dominican Republic. One positive note is that the concierge via the app are very responsive and helpful though.

The kids areas were what drew us to the resort and they are indeed fantastic. Playroom and splash pads are great! Playroom is well run and the staff there are actually quite nice (unlike the rest of the resort).",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Amenities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Cleanliness, staff & service, property conditions & facilities","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children",,,

The a-la-crate food was actually good for a resort. The rooms and facilities were decent. However, I do no appreciate the sales vultures trying to sell you a voucher or membership. I wasted my entire morning with a sales person because I just wanted a credit to the spa. In the end I was so annoyed I didn’t even take the credit. The sales ppl don’t take no for an answer and to be honest ruined my day. I came here to relax and this was the opposite I was livid. I probably wouldn’t visit here again, there’s likely other resorts and places I would visit first before I come here again. It felt like everything had a catch to it, I couldn’t relax the way I wanted to. Likely wouldn’t recommend to a friend.

we went for our anniversary trip, however it wasn’t good. 
Some staff members were nice and some didn’t care at all. Had bad experience at Grand moon cancun. 
bed sheet didn’t get change from past 2 days.My son had dropped chocolate , and we could see the marks on the bedsheet for the next 2 days.
 
I asked public relations to set up anniversary surprise for my wife and they fogot to do it. 

Very long walk to restuarants and lobbys, and wait time for carts are long. Worse thing was they had one elevator - very old and it was n’t working most of the time.

Washroom needs updating for rooms in sunrise. 

Only one thing good was front desk allowed late check out until 2:00pm however our bus was at 5:00pm to the airport.

When I provided them feedback all I hot an apology at public relations. The person name was Alejandro. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Cleanliness, staff & service, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

First, the hotel is not friendly for kids with stroller, the ramps  are enough in the lobby but not around the pool area. So, you need to go around and walk long distance if you need to go from area to other around the pool.
The drinks are served in plastic cup that are NOT disposable, and clearly these cups are not washed properly. They are visibly dirty. 
The check in and check out process is super complicated, first they will take your bags at the door and they give you a small ticket, after check in they will give you another ticket to go back outside the hotel to give to the bell boys so they can take your luggage to your room. Then, it is on your own to find your room, the directions given to the room are not enough and not clear, there is one elevator for the building and good luck to you in finding it. The room numbers at the bottom of the building are written in a small font that you can barely read ( if you find the sign).
Long line at check out at 7 AM and only one person available, no special treatment for what is called VIP Expedia guest, everyone is the same. The bell boys called us one day before our departure to confirm pick up time for our luggage, then next day no one showed up and we had to called them again to send someone and were told that we dont have a reservation. We are almost gonna miss our transportation back to the airport because of them.

The beach was practically empty and the water is dark not the water that I am familiar with when visiting Cancun area in the past. I attempted to switch hotel from the first night and I was told that nothing they can do to help. It appears that guests who book through Expedia are target for staff to sell timeshare not to provide service and make them want to come back. Overall the stay was bad as I used the facility to sleep. I will not recommend this hotel to people who want to relax and have a pleasant experience in Mexico. I do not recommend this hotel because it is it is huge and crowded and gave me the feelings that I am in a chicken factory.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, property conditions & facilities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Staff & service","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children","Traveled with group",,

The service at Nizuc was great from everyone, except from customer relations when I had issue about an Expedia VIP offer. I asked to speak to the manager and they said the complaints stop with them. Poorly handled. Many staff members were great,  but I go back to the CR team who were poor at handling issues. I would like to highlight the in-stay concierge Hugo, who actually did everything possible to resolve what CR could not in a satisfactory manner.

We absolutely loved the moon palace and all that it offers, especially for little ones! He definitely could have done more if he was bigger but that's no fault of theirs. The moon palace is amazing! My only down fall is that we did attempt to order room service twice with needing to be back at our room earlier then normal with a little one and it took longer then the time stated and it was late so we just ended up canceling. I wouldn't really knocked any points for then but it was a little disappointing for it to take over an hour (longer then it said it would take) to where we just ended up canceling! Other then that, staff was so accommodating and so so so friendly to our little guy even in his sleepy cranky moments they would try to make him laugh or distract him and help entertain him! They were all so kind! Definitely kid friendly in so many aspects but it helps when the staff are patient with little ones as well!

Moon Palace is great, but Nizuc does not have a lot for kids. We stayed at the Sunrise and there were a lot of activities for my daughter.

One thing I learned: if you book Moon Palace Cancun do not think that you will guaranteed to stay at the Cancun/Sunsire as advertised. According to the staff there, you can either stay at the Sunrise or Nizuc which sucks! Thankfully we stayed at the Sunrise like we wanted because of the kid's pool. I would be very upset if I booked Moon Palace Cancun, and stayed at the Nizuc.

The staff at the restaurants are very nice and the food is amazing. The only problem is getting a reservation for Agra, the Indian restaurant. We were there for a week and they never had a spot for us even trying every day. For the restaurants that do not require reservation, you have to be ready to wait 1hr to be seated.

One thing and very important: if you are looking for a blue water beach, stay away from Moon Palace. The beach is horrible!!!! Smells bad and is far away from blue. If you want blue water go to Hotel Zone Resorts.

If you want a resort with a lot of activities for kids and if you are okay staying in the pool and not having a blue water beach, the Moon Palace is great!!!

We felt very frustrated when we got there and could not enjoy the beach at all.


The resort was extremely crowded, so I guess next time I won't go during summer.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children",,,

He contacted someone at the front desk who also could not find the reservation number.  Rather then trying to help us (clearly not our mistake as I showed them proof of the reservation confirmation) my family was told the reservation does not exist and we had to leave.  I refused to leave as we were in a taxi and had no where to go and I insisted they contact another representative to help us.  After 45 minutes someone finally found our reservation and let us in.  We did not receive a legitimate apology and I tried to make a formal complaint.  Given the amount of money we spent at this place I expected someone to step up and make things right but that did not happen.  The family was very upset at a time that should have been exciting.  We had to pay the taxi driver an additional $30 for his time and he was very understanding and also could not understand why we were treated so poorly.

A good experience at this hotel. My daughter was bug bitten in her bed. Addressed the situation with public relations and they facilitated us to see the doctor. My surprise was that the doctor’s room was dirty and disgusting. Dead bugs on the floor including a cockroach, the bed sheet had BLOOD in it and the doctor did. It realized it. When I told my daughter not to lay on that bed, the doctor apologized and said that the cleaning for that room is horrible and they have issues with the hotel about cleanliness. 
The hotel finally changed our bedroom to prevent more bug bites! At this point I just wanted to go HOME. The showers were not clean either. The wall with a box for shampoo and soap was moldy. Food wasn’t that great but acceptable for a all inclusive hotel. 
Not a really good experience! And the beach is not the greatest in Cancun! No body uses it because is full of weed and water’s a Coca Cola color! Not pleasant!

The downside of the hotel, if you’re planning on exploring the area, is that the resort is far from beaches and other activities. Also, all the construction happening due to the Maya train delayed traffic when leaving the resort and it made traveling places a bit frustrating. As far as the resort, it was very clean, and we never waited more than 5 minutes for a golf cart to come around to be taken around the resort. The lobby is at a walkable distance if you don’t want to use the golf carts for transportation. The food options were great, my family really enjoyed having meals at Bugambilias, one of the resort’s restaurants, as they are a buffet style restaurant. The hotel has a beach and walks on it were nice. There was a broad array of alcoholic beverages at all restaurants. The gym was really clean and it offered towels and water and fruit for the way out and it faced the pools and beach, making working out very relaxing. I highly recommend this resort if you are looking to relax during your stay.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children",,,

We stayed at Sunrise which is the second best in between the three and the Grand being the top. The resorts have multiple two story buildings and they are all around the main building where you dine and the pool area is. To get to your room depends how far your room is from the main building it could take you a long walk. There are golf carts to take you to your room but you have to wait 10  minutes in hot weather for them to come. It’s not very convenient. If you need anything from your room to go back and forth is a hustle. Due to the size of the resorts it is very crowded. Making reservations to some of the better restaurants is impossible. Don’t get me wrong there are many restaurants and bars but if you want to go to a top restaurant where you need reservations then good luck. 
When you check in and you are not in the Grand usually they want you to upgrade which is not worth it DO NOT DO IT. The also want to ask you to go for a tour of the grant and then they will give you one day pass to enjoy it, again DO NOT DO IT. They want you to buy and they are very pushy. They started from $16k and ended up to $300 to buy a membership. Unfortunately we didn’t know and we agreed to the tour which was a big mistake and waste of our time. 
If you are booking thought Expedia or other sites if they have the option of booking for excursion it will be a better choice because they will give discounts. I hope this helps you.

Mostly all waiters were very nice!!! The Italian restaurant Trattoria had a male waiter that wasn’t like the rest but he wasn’t disrespectful just seemed very unhappy and tired of his job. I would recommend that the lobby get more bands that play music that is lively for some dancing. Latin night at the lobby was fun because of the music that was upbeat.

I was impressed by the Customer service, all the staff was amazing, polite and has a smile on their face. We loved the food at Gondola for breakfast and dinner. Momo for dinner, Pier which also served seafood was great. They had plenty of food choices! 
We visited Nizuc, it’s smaller than Sunrise. But the Brazilian Steakhouse was superb. 
 We also had day passes for The Grand… The Grand was good, not great. We went there for the water park.. which was OK… my children wanted to go back to Sunrise after two hours.. they had more fun there. Sunrise is bigger, than Nizuc, more kid friendly and has multiple swimming pools. 
The Moon Palace resort is sooo large, I am glad they had a bus that transports you from Lobby to Lobby, and golf carts that can transport you. 
 
Food wise: we enjoyed every restaurants we went to, though we were not able to go to the ones with reservations. Maybe next time…
Overall, the food - from breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, desserts, coffee, fresh fruit smoothies, alcohol, cocktails was amazing. The staff were amazing.. from the bell boys, Coach driver, receptionists, masseuse, servers, waiters, food service, room service, operators, baristas and I mean EVERYONE. They make eye contact and had smiles on their faces, and instead of saying “you’re welcome” they say “My pleasure”. I am really impressed. 
I would recommend this resort if you want to have an amazing vacation. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

- our air conditioner didn’t work one full day (it was stifling hot in the room and we had to leave immediately because we were concerned about the health of our children.
- the days the air conditioner was working, it never was what the thermostat read and partly because of the poor designs of the room where the vent was pointing towards an ill positioned bathtub and not towards the beds.  
- the beds were so small.  An adult and child could not comfortably sleep.  It was awful.  
- the property was slippery everywhere and there were multiple falls
- the manager was rude and kept targeting us.

It is still our go to for All Inclusive's in Cancun and we will definitely be back next summer. But things have changed a bit. Maybe it was just this visit but the amount of kids on the property was overwhelming. The amount of screaming and crying as well as unsupervised running around and swimming definitely took away some of the peace you expect during dinners and lounging. That may not be the hotels fault completely but it was a noticiable difference. Another big change was the amount of onsite time share (though they don’t call it that) staff on site with a constant presence in the lobby and an upped effort on their part to try and sell you something. And these are just the big things needing mention. They do not take away from the amazing staff, food, amenities and services available here. I would rate this last stay an 8/10. And that’s coming from a picky and strong critic willing to write this story book a review so believe me that 8 is great! But in the past all our stays have been 10  so that being said maybe it was just the unlucky first dates of stay with a ton of children and sales staff on site but without those 2 cons the Moon Palace is still the only place I’m my opinion worth dropping the above average all inclusive cash on in Cancun and we will be back for sure. Staff food and things offered are still all top tier!

The proposed trip to their most expensive property The Grand was very disappointing. They took us directly to some big room with many sales people which tried to sell us membership, no one even offer as a glass of water. Since we didn't bought it, they just left us there on our own to find our way back to Sunrise resort where we were staying. Very disappointing experience.

Pools are very clean. Kids had a great time! 

Beach is not great. We did some kayaking in it. There is a smell from the seaweed but they don’t really have any control over it. The number of pools make up for it.

The service was fine, but not very friendly. 

The positives: it’s reasonably priced for a family vacation, it’s a short ride to the airport and the rooms are a decent size. 

Would we ever go back to a Palace Resort property? As I told the employee who was trying to sell us another week as we were departing… we will never come here again. But, If you are looking for a solid C  vacation this is the spot.

Rooms are spacious, the service was great where they cleaned it twice a day. Restaurants are good with lot of  options to try. Being vegetarian the options were a bit limited else there were a lot of options. 

We were in Nizuc which is the smallest of all the three Moon palace resorts but got free access to Sunrise which had good number of restaurants and activities to do. Loved the Hibachi styled dinner at the Momos Teppanyaki, which requires a reservation, which is a live cooking and the chef entertained the family through out.

Pool side drinks and food was good and quite relaxing to spend time with family without moving a lot for lunch and come back to the pool.

Downsides - Checkin process was lengthy and took almost an hour once we entered the lobby. 
Getting around takes a good amount of time being a massive resort. Though there were golf carts, going between the resorts still required some time due to the size of the resort.
Felt the vegetarian options should have been bit more, personally being a vegetarian family
Though major part of the pools were clean, pockets of the pools were not clean with dirt floating around and should be maintained well

Dinner is really screwed up. You wait in long lines only to be told it’s another hour wait. The hostesses at the steakhouse and the buffet are rude. We found all waiters and waitresses to be very kind. We loved room service and it’s so nice that it is 24 hours. It alway arrived rather quickly and hot. The restaurants need to take reservations or tell people before they get in the line that it’s an hour wait. 
My sister had a broken foot. They assured us they would accommodate or we would have cancelled. They were not at all accommodating because we weren’t Diamond level. We could have rescheduled but didn’t and I wish we had. The food was good. The drinks were good. The pool could have been cleaner. It had a lot of junk floating in it. All and all it was a pretty good time. We probably won’t come back to this property though.

We stayed at Nizuc and were back and forth between Nizuc and Sunrise.  Visitors can visit the grand for an additional charge (which we did not do).

The resort is massive, and you’ll likely have to hop on a golf cart of bus to navigate through the hotels depending on where you’re room is, but was not much of a hassle at all.

Nizuc was more calm and family oriented during our stay, where sunrise had a more lively environment with mixed ages.  Sunrise also had a lot more options for dining and a much bigger pool.  Our son is 4, and he had an amazing time at both resorts.

A few of the restaurants required reservations, which I’d recommend getting ahead of asap as spots fill up quickly.  There are plenty of options that don’t require a reservation, and we did not have to wait to be seated once.  Restaurants are open for a bulk of the day, and the room service menu runs around the clock.  The food was good, plenty of options for our family despite being vegetarian, and were generally accommodating.

Both resorts have play places for little ones, and sunrise has an arcade for the slightly older kids.  There is a bar at Nizuc and club at Sunrise dedicated specifically for adults.  The resort does a great job offering shows/ live music to enjoy during the evenings and there are plenty of activities available for the kids.

Id recommend the spa and golf course as well",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children","Traveled with family",,

unfortunately, what went wrong, our reservation stated Moon Palace The Grand. when we reached the hotel they told me we are at sunrise even our shuttle took us to the Grand, which was very disappointing as we book with the resort to enjoy the water park and didn't get to experience the park. we were not informed why the change or giving access to the park. we did enjoy the Sunrise resort and the stuff, but would have loved to experience the water park

The other main issue has been the inconvenience of the staff. There is a million different offices/desks to get something done, almost like a government entity.

We had paid a high fee for the entire vacation up front. When booking through Expedia, the booking screens said that all amenities were included.

When we arrived tired and thirsty, after an extremely long journey, we were taken to the wrong Moon Palace Property (the Grand) because our reservation did not say ""Nizuc"" on it and we had been booked (Without our knowledge) at Nizuc). Then the cab driver took us to Nizuc. Then, after some delay, we were checked in but with no welcome drink. We were asked ""what are you looking forward to on this vacation?"" and I said that my son is looking forward to the water park.  Suddenly they said water park access is not included and is subject to  a very high per-person per-day additional fee unless we sit through a 90 minute sales presentation for membership of their hotel, in which case we could get a few free day passes.  We explained the reservation had stated it was all included, but they refused. Being exhausted, we said we'd have to think about it. When we arrived at the room we were very shocked and saddened to discover that the ocean was grey/green and murky - nothing like the pictures. There was clearly some sargassum clean-up operation happening but it was nowhere near enough. Also we got sick from a drink in an unwashed cup that was served to our son.

Staff was fantastic. Restaurants were varied and excellent food. Close to airport and Cancun.

What I didn't like.
Am a member of Palace Premiere - didn't book direct with them because cost was over $13,000 C more. As result, they treat you as second class citizens. Would not provide free transfers from and to Airport. Used Happy Shuttle cheaper than their transportation.  Requested 3 rooms in a same building on floors 2 or 3 - 2.5 months ago and then E Mailed them two weeks before arrival. Their response was we would get what was available. On arrival - 5pm, 2 rooms in building 80 - 1 each on 1st and 2nd floor. My third room was 2nd floor building 79. My room in building 80 was still occupied. Contacted desk, Got moved to Building 77. After supper, I complained and then they agreed to move us next door to my daughter's room in Building 79 the next day but not until after 4 pm but I had to be out of my room in Building 77 before 12 pm. Lost next day moving. Beach is awful with sea grass constantly washing up onto shore and in the water. Not swimable. Inadequate aquatic equipment for the number of guests. We had 3 people per room - only got towel and robe & slipper service for 2. Had to daily get extra towels from maids. So much for giving extra tip ahead of service",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

We lost a day because we felt like we were going to be taken to a nice lunch and explore one of the other parts of the resort. Instead we got the standard buffet and a 90 minute presentation on their ""membership"". We felt like we were lied, the ""value"" gained from the lost day was not equal to the time wasted. 
*Also they serve alcohol to you while telling you to spend money on their membership which feels pretty irresponsible of the company
--
Over all, everything outside of them trying to get you going in and coming out was great. 
""...One time purchase of $299 to lock in your price to stay at another property for 5 days 4 nights, the pay the rest of the $1200  over the next X months..."" We got talked to about the deal 3 times which was very frustrating when we told them we already heard the deal. During the presentation we told them it wasn't financially responsible to make purchase this and they continued to double down on trying to get us to buy the membership.
-
My advice... 
- Stay away from any of the ""concierge"", they will just try to sell you something
- ""The Grand"" $100 day pass is not worth it
Side Note:
If you are staying at an all inclusive resort and you pay for an excursion just think about how much time you are not going to be using the amenities and whether it is worth it or not",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, amenities, property conditions & facilities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Staff & service","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Many of the staff was rude. 
I am a Spanish speaking American. If you speak Spanish you were treated like a second class citizen. ALL they care about is the ( $)tips. They picked and chose who they spoke to well. 
At some point I was called out on dressing code by a woman called fernanda at the pier 8 restaurant (Sunday (3/19/23) according to her because her boss told her to. It was pouring outside and I was with my elderly mother and two small kids. I tried to shield from the rain in the restaurant and also feed my kids (2 and 6) which was next to the kids pool She stopped me with an extremely rude tone at the entrance and told me I could not get into the restaurant to feed my kids because I was wearing  see through clothes, when I looked around there was around three female white Americans dressed with the same dress as me. 
I told her. “ you stop me from going in there if you ask all of those women to leave “ she “ let “ me in. 

We came and sat close to the sitting Host area, obviously many people came In directly from the pool because of the weather conditions and NONE that came in with bathing suits or dresses like mine were told anything. 
I took pictures and took it to the “ relations” area. I hope something is done. 
if you just want to relax and not be thinking about tipping everyone just because they smile (DO NOT GO HERE)

The place is costly and I have to deal with nasty attitude and negligence from the staff?! 👎

The water is ugly  (one day at the beach the water was black then reddish brown) and cleanup boats in front of the hotels with blue buoys (that enclosed the ENTIRE Moon Palace resort properties water) to ruin your view of the water. It was like a Superfund Industrial Waster Clean up with Dump trucks loaded with seaweed being hauled up and down the beach ALL Day. Tractors up and down the beach. Tons and tons of children running around with no supervision. Drunk spring break kids. Hall ways in Sunrise were littered with trash and piles of dirty dishes.
Only 3 positives - #1 We paid a TON of money to upgrade our room and it was nice in the Nizuc building with less children. #2 Gym - Ana Kieri instructor for Yoga and Pool Bike class was a great coach and funny! The Yoga band of 2 guys were excellent as well. #3 was Jacqueline our wait staff at the beach/pool (we found a great spot away from the noise/pool with a view to the clean up boats and nasty surf water - distant water was pretty ....)

1. When we arrived, we were bombarded by the staff trying to get us to do activities and didn't even let us check in or relax before we had staff trying to get us to do all kinds of adventures and do a full day trip to the Grand. We had NO TIME to get familiar with our surroundings and check in and get to our room before everyone tried to get us to sign up for all kinds of stuff. We were exhausted after our flight and just wanted to check in, go to our room and relax first. That was so annoying and frustrating! 
2. The showers are EXTREMELY unsafe. We fell multiple times because the floor was extremely slippery. There should be anti slip bath mats in the showers. I fell and bruised my butt, my husband fell twice and he has a broke back so that was very concerning.
3. We were put in a room way, way far away from everything and the walk to the pool was excruciatingly painful.
Other than that, the stay was perfect and the golf cart guys were totally awesome!
The pool.sraff at Sunrise were so, so cool and that's one reason we're coming back. We LOVED 
Luis...he was so funny and we loved him!
Marco, Carlos and Jos (Joslin)were amazing. Tell Jossline we loved her attitude and her funny acrobatic. Her splits were so cool. The pool staff is hilarious and we loved all of them!
Oh, and more swim up pool bartenders would really help. The bar was constantly packed and took over half an hour to order drinks. 
We tipped everyone that helped us $20 every time!",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, property conditions & facilities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Staff & service","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with partner",,,

Namely, the drinks. We were not expecting top notch drinks but what we were served was extremely watered down, syrupy or tasted like vinegar (in the case of wine) and there was something clearly other than water being mixed in the liquor as well as the drinks tasted awful. We noticed other people had complained as well. One night we decided to splurge and get a 2016 Barolo. The bottle was opened in front of us, however, the cork (no color on it at all for a bottle that was allegedly laying on its side for 7 years)was spotless and the wine tasted like vinegar (once again). Felt like a scam and we did not purchase the bottle. The room cleanliness on a daily basis was also a hit and miss. We have small children (5 & 2) so the sheets would get dirty with their feet and the beds would be remade with the same visibly dirty sheets. It was also extremely difficult to book any of the restaurants where a reservation was required as were given conflicting information of when the reservations opened up for the restaurants and even for the restaurants where a reservation was not required, if you did not line up before the restaurant opened, it was a minimum 2hr wait to eat. It is a nice resort as long as you're really not looking to have any drinks (even though you're paying for them in the rate) but we will look for other options for our next visit to Mexico.

The CONS - the description through Expedia does not accurately reflect the amenities that are actually available. There are 3 separate resorts in Cancun - Nizuc, Sunrise and The Grand. The grand is it own entity, and you do have to pay extra to be able to access the resort and it’s amenities, such as the water park. 

The other CON - the number of sales pitches we received while there. They have a fantastic facility, but due to the sales pitches to buy future vacations, I’m not certain I will return… they’d be better off getting the sales people out of there and allowing their facilities and staff bring people back again!

When we arrived, it was late, and when we checked in it seemed nice, but it was dark so we couldn't see everything.   The next morning we woke up to the sounds of trucks beeping, loud banging, and many men shouting.  We opened the curtains to see no ocean view...but instead, many trucks, cranes, and other construction vehicles lined up in front of our room, blocking the view to the ocean almost completely.  Not to mention the noise they were making.  They were constructing something right in front of our room. there were at least 50-75 men yelling and drilling, and banging.  I called the front desk to have our room moved, and instead of saying sorry for the noise and inconvenience, we were told there were not any rooms to ,move us to until the next day.  So, the next day we waited all day for them to move us, and finally at 6:00pm they told us they finally had our room ready.  They then proceeded to move us to the same view the next building over one floor up.  This room ALSO had the same noise, construction and obstructed views.  I complained, and they spoke to their manager, and they said there were NO rooms available, and we had no other choice.  SO....needless to say I will be writing to the GM of the hotel, and voicing my displeasure, as we should have been moved to a room with the unobstructed ocean view we paid for.  totally unacceptable.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with group",,,

This place is huge- lots to explore. They seem short staffed for the size. For example it is very difficult to get drinks and especially food at the pool. As many others have mentioned, the beach is not great. They do attempt to clean up seaweed and manicure the sand, but that’s about it. They could really improve the beach set up.
My main issue with MP was the hard push to up-sell. I was offered at least 3 room/ suite upgrades at check in after traveling 12 hours with 4 kids. We just wanted to get to our room! It was incredibly annoying and frustrating. It is VERY clear that the staff gets a cut for up selling, as everyone tries to give you their name when you are “ready to learn more” or go on a “free tour of the Grand.”

The service was excellent and the food was some of the best we have had at an all inclusive. Although the rooms and hotel are older in style, they are kept up very well and the property is very clean. Our housekeeper Epifania was outstanding as well as the staff in general. Everyone is kind, friendly and helpful - we didn’t come across anyone rude our entire 6 nights. Having access to Nizuc was fun and we enjoyed dinner there one night. It is difficult to get a reservation at the restaurants but fortunately there are so many that don’t require them and they were all very good. The only negatives were probably that the beach had seaweed (impossible to control although they do try) and that the coffee shop is slow and the line is very disorganized but definitely a first world problem.

It is near-impossible to get a reservation at the specialty restaurants. The buffets options were bland, a lot of the restaurants had really long lines. At one of the a la carte restaurants, we had to flag 3 people down over 20 minutes just to get menus because the host seated us without them. 

As soon as we checked into Moon Palace we were told we should have stayed at the Grand as that's where the amenities are, and we needed to pay ~$250 USD per day to access the Grand.

The beach isn't swimmable. Lines for the water activities were long. 

The pool and rooms were nice.

Only stay here if you're not big on food or activities and just want to drink by a pool all day.

There is pros and cons to being this large. With small kids it can be difficult because you really can’t just walk around so you would have to wait for the golf carts to pick you up. But with a property so large there is so much to do!  The pool is large which is nice because you don’t feel cramped and there is always chairs you can find. The dinner situation can be challenging if you’re looking to eat dinner when you go to the restaurant. Having a small baby, it was hard waiting 1-2 hours even when getting to the restaurant exactly when it opened. May not be an issue for everyone, as you can wait out the time by getting drinks.

We were however very disappointed that we were never able to make any reservations during our visit despite calling to make them daily at 10a and going to the customer service desk each time because the app always said no tables during your stay. We also were unable to eat at any of the restaurants that were ala carte bc we got in line at 530 (opened at 6) by the time we reached the desk in line an hour later, we were told each time 9p for our table. Again, we were traveling with small children so this was simply unacceptable. It seems as the resort lets the 3 attached hotels use all restaurants we were unable to even get to enjoy our own. We chose this property bc of the numerous food options but only ever got to eat buffet and poolside snacks. After speaking with the staff nothing was done or offered to try to compensate this disappointment. We also are aware of the high volume of travelers during our week but as we paid full price we expected full inclusion as advertised, including the food options.

The rooms were way to small and cramped for 4 people. Our shower head was broken and we didn’t have hot water twice.  
The lines were long for everything.  We could not get dinner reservations at any of the restaurants even when we tried to book them right as we checked in. 
Not enough chairs by the pool or beach for everyone.  The ocean had a ton of seaweed and wasn’t something you wanted to swim in. Definitely not the blue, clear water you expect of in Cancun. 
Food and drinks were subpar. 
They called our room every morning asking us to come to a time share presentation.  Every-time we went to the lobby- we were asked to do the timeshare presentation. 
We were given resort  credits by Expedia and Moon palace.  Then told that they didn’t apply to anything in the stores but a bottle of tequila or a pair of sunglasses or a beach bag. Overall, probably our worst resort experience ever.   And our most expensive to date.

To top it all, it rained for almost half of our stay, and there were ZERO activities planned by the hotel to do indoors with the kids except the playroom (Nizuc) which is incredibly small and boring for the kids.

The bell boys were lazy didn’t want to help show you your room when you arrived like the front desk stated they would and would just direct you to walk down a dark path with more so many buildings of rooms. They were rude on the golf carts. If you wanted to be treated right make sure you speak English. If you speak Spanish they treat you like their own and not courteous. We spent $2k for 3 nights just to be treated with no respect. The food was always cold and pasta taste like pasta water with no flavor. I don’t recommend their Italian food. Let’s not forget the taco lady in the buffet who had attitude every time you would order tacos. Unfortunately, that’s all my son likes, but she always smirked her mouth and rolled her eyes when my son will come back for more. This is an all inclusive he can eat all he wants but she had a problem making them. She made my son feel uncomfortable, who do not speak Spanish so I would have to go and get them. The shower kept going out when you were showing with water turning off. The tv had no signal so we couldn’t watch TV in our room and they kept  saying it was an issue they were working on. Even though this place was all inclusive the food was better outside.

And the property is very far from outside activities, even ones you book through the hotel that we felt like we wasted a ton of our vacation waiting in lines or stuck in a bus. Lastly, the resort credits we were told we had were not honored when we checked out because they claimed we had to tell the shop/tour we wanted to use them at the time of purchase, which nobody informed us of to start with, so I feel like the property essentially took an additional couple hundred dollars from us.

3) Even worse is that  the ""managing"" staff did not try to help even the chaos was reported (to a lady sitting behind the 1st floor escalator time ~ 12:30 pm  on 12/21) -same chaos  continue after report

The option for king vs two doubles are “upon availability” so they expected two adults and a teenager to all sleep in a king…they ended up bringing a twin sized bed in the room which helped but made it super cramped.  The restaurants all have a two hour wait unless you show up at 6pm when they open.  Book your trips through Expedia bc the hotel will charge 3x as much for the exact same trip.  Overall it was a fun experience.  The hotel feels more like Vegas than any other hotel in Mexico we have stayed.  They have golf carts to drive you all over the grounds but expect to wait up to 15-20 minutes depending on where you wanna go.

They’re basically useless unless you use them for the overpriced SPA. We were there for a wedding so there were events and stuff with friends across the resort but we weren’t told anything about intra hotel transportation having a schedule (we thought it was 24h) so at 1 AM when they kick us out of the “pub” everyone had to walk all the way back to their rooms in a different hotel in the property. We were given a complimentary “welcome cheese and meat plate” which was riddled with ants (probably sat out for a long time). Construction in the room next door woke us up both mornings. Food is absolutely disgusting with the only exception being the tacos - they weren’t good but they were edible. The beach was horrible, maybe it was the time of year, but I’ve never seen a resort that full with a beach that empty in Cancun. The only decent thing about the hotel is the fact that light is not a problem in the rooms and toiletries are better than a lot of other places. 
TL;DR: Would not recommend, won’t come back. Way too overpriced, bad service, bad food, bad liquor, scammer behavior. I would not pay more than $250 for this all-inclusive resort.

Three of our rooms had cockroaches. We filed complaint and they said there were no reports of cockroaches. We knew this was a lie because I files my report the day before my sister files hers. 

Public relations was very unprofessional as I was filling my report. I asked to speak to a manager and they said no one was available at the moment. He pretended to call a manager on his cell phone and was taking incoming phone calls on the desk phone. 

Our room was fumigated but we did not feel but we did not feel comfortable. 

My sister made three reports and even showed public relations pictures of several size cockroaches. Public relations said they weee small and nothing to worry about. My sister asked to be changed to another room but it took two whole days to finally get a different room.  

As we were checking out of the hotel we made it known to the people asking us how our stay was but it seems all the staff there know they have problems but don’t care. 

A few teenagers and adults in our group had had visible bite marks all over their bodies. We suspect it could’ve been bed bugs.

The line will take you over 2 hours. There are multiple steps to check in and it basically wastes the entire day, which you already paid for. Rooms used to be much cleaner. Mold in the tub. Sheets smelled like body odor. We asked them to be changed and they changed them, but not the pillow cases. We had to call the front desk multiple times. The jets in the jacuzzi dont work. It’s one of the more expensive cancun resorts so I would have just expected a nicer experience.

We really enjoyed the break dancing show which is the only one we saw.  The rooms were awesome and liked the bathtub and hammock was a great touch.  The price was right.  The service everywhere was excellent.  It was disappointing the ocean had the seaweed problem.  We would not come back this time of year due to that.  It's probably out of control of the resort though.  The quality of food was not that great except for the breakfast by the spa/golf course.  We were hoping for some higher quality mexican food and pasta wasn't very good.  If the resort did one think they should make the food better quality at all the locations.  The drinks were really good and so was the access to it.  The $150 credit was a bit pointless since there was only one wall in the boutique with overpriced items, so we never used it. That seemed like a scam and I don't think they're fooling anyone.  Overall it was  a great experience and we would come again!",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

It has more to do with their geographic location than red tide or rain. I knew ahead of time and was okay with it.

Specialty Dining: What a nightmare. It’s like Black Friday mixed with trying to win concert tixs on the radio at 10am daily. You have to stop what you’re doing, run to a landline at 958am and start dialing to get thru for reservations. If you don’t care about specialty dining then there’s plenty of restaurants that will accommodate your meal needs.

Timeshare: If you give them an inkling that you might be interested, then be prepared for solicitation calls daily to your room. After 3 calls, we gave in. They showed us around their favorite child “The Grand”, and I can see why they’re proud of it. 90 mins of lending my time and we left w our passes.

The Grand: it’s a beautiful resort. Both buffet & specialty dining was great but you’ll need day passes if you’re staying in Sunrise or Nizuc.  The water park is the only subpar amenity.

Spa: Worth it! Restaurant and bar on premise were just as great.

Why I won’t got back: Between warm beers & consistent miscommunication, it was frustrating.  Redeeming day passes became a hassle daily bc rules kept changing. Hopping on golf carts was another Black Friday event, don’t walk, run.  Wasn’t relaxing at all.  

Tips: Do tip the staff that take care of you. It’s worth it for both parties. They’ll take care of you.

The beach front there isn’t very suitable to swim.  A lot of seaweed.  And also the beaches at the hotel row aren’t suitable for us because of the heavy currents.  If you are looking for seimable safe water for little kids target your stay at a resort that is up top that which the isle of mujares blocks the current.  I don’t know if that makes sense!  Again time of the year could effect water conditions.  We traveled in august.  
Moon palace had great facilities.   Every kind of pools and amazing food!  Was perfect for our family!   If possible stay at moon palace grand.  It will be more pricey but you won’t have to pay for any day passes to go the other resorts on that property.

Pool is subpar compared to the others. Stay at Sunrise if you don’t want to pay the price for grand. Don’t book through third party site. You’ll get a wristband with a color pertaining to that fact. I booked 2 rooms and my brother booked the same type of room for the same days. We called a month in advance to request the rooms be put together but they stated to call a day or two before. We called the day before check in and they ‘put a note’ in our file. Day of check in we asked to be next to each other. Check In process took almost a half hour and I. The end they couldn’t put us near each other. They were on opposite sides of the resort and we measured it, it was a half mile away and a ten minute walk from each other. We did the member recruitment to get the hotel credit and when we asked why we couldn’t be by each they said if we signed up for the membership they’d put us together. We didn’t sign up. So overall the experience will be much better if you’re a member of the resort. Staff was courteous for the most part. Facilities are clean and nice. The grand is much much nicer. Food was pretty good IMO. Don’t expect any kind of special treatment or accommodations unless you fork out the 80k for the lowest membership package. Also don’t book airport transportation through them. It was a joke. Just google and set up your own. Faster and much easier. Also cheaper. Or if you can find a member and use their weeks. That’d be better ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Room comfort","Sub par for non members of their club.

They said it would take 90 min we were there for almost 4 hours.  They wouldn’t take no for an answer.  I felt that the resort was more of a market than relaxation.  The Spa was great!   Some of the workers were very friendly especially Roberto and Anna.  It rained the whole time and there wasn’t enough activities indoors.  Most people were sitting around lobby.  The club was only open 1 day.  We had a few issues with the room that was resolved quickly.  I also fell due to wet floors and slipped multiple times  me and several other guests as well.  Once we
Said no to timeshare it seemed as though the hospitality declined.  The drinks were not as good and the food was repetitive.  Our Swimup suite was nice we just couldn’t use it much due to storms.  Housekeeping put balloons in my room for my birthday and the room wasn’t even cleaned yet for the day.  They didn’t pay much attention to detail.  I felt the resort was too big and that made it lose the personal attention and hospitality felt more like a convention.

I have no idea why Expedia has a ""very good"" 4 star rating!!!...I made the mistake and not checking Yelp.... there is a ton of 1 star reviews there. Make sure you read those reviews before booking!!! I was forced to use the upstairs ""VIP"" check in that took 45 minutes! there was nobody in line downstairs at the normal check in but they would not let me check in there. Upon check in the hotel representative repeatedly tried to get me to sign up for a 2 hour time share meeting. I told her no multiple times but would not take no for an answer. She was way more interested in signing me up for the time share then checking me in. After finally getting my room access I had what it seemed to be like a 1/2 mile walk to the room. Once arriving at the building we encountered a beyond NASTY SEWER smell the whole place smelled like ASS. Once arriving in the room it was dirty and was decorated like a low budget motel 6 from 1990. Needless to say I check out within an hour and went to another hotel. I wasted hours time with my family time dealing with this.

Pros: Playroom! Traveling with a 2 year old is not always easy but the staff at the Sunrise Playroom were amazing! Thank you ladies!  

Cons: the beds in the double rooms are very small and trying to switch rooms was impossible. Housekeeping didn’t clean the rooms just made the beds.

Expedia VIP perks were a wine and champagne bottle. We were not able to get a room upgrade or were not able to use the resort credit.

The food was very good and there were many food types of options and variety of places to eat.

 The pool style and concepts were very good for our family. The condition and aging of the hotel rooms did not match the quality of the other aspects of the vacation resort. 
The grounds around the buildings were very well-kept and beautiful.
I especially want to acknowledge 2 individuals who worked there that were exceptional. 
Berniece who worked in the Salon who gives the best massage I’ve ever had. 
And Jorge Campos and team at Bugambilias restaurant. Apolinio, Ingrid
Rodriguez
Miguel Paniagua
Jorge knew 4 languages and his English was excellent. He was so cheerful, helpful and worked very hard to serve us. He deserves recognition for his outstanding attitude and service.

Upon checking-in we were communicated our two bedroom reservation at Nizuc was not available. After not being given a room option since they were overbooked we were then send to a welcome representative. We quickly discovered the “welcome” expectation was only to book us for a timeshare presentation at the Grand resort. The representative not once respected or validated our flight fatigue and disappointment with our check-in. 

We were then transferred to a King bedroom in Sunrise with a rollaway bed. Immediately upon entering the Sunrise room, we were overwhelmed with the seaweed ordor inside the room.

As a result, we spent approximately 4 hours and our rest of the evening requesting to have our double bed room and transferred to Nizuc. We were send to public relations only to discover nobody there and waited over 45 minutes before finding a manager to assist us. 

After finally having our room changed to Nizuc, but still no double bed, we had to carry our own luggage to the main Sunrise Lobby since our bell took service never arrived after waiting an hour. 

In terms of restaurant reservation, it’s difficult to make reservations and the hostess often appeared overwhelmed trying to manage the large crowds. 

Although we received a ocean view room, the ocean at Moon Palace is dark brown and they constantly have to clean the the seaweed. 

In sum, we will not return to Moon Palace. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Staff harassed us by calling every morning  between 7-9am to get us to tour the Grand for time share. Staff then tried to follow us out to shuttle on our last day to get us to commit to paying $500 for “great deal” to stay at a later date. He would not take no for an answer and I had to tell him multiple times not to follow us out because I was not interested. The wait staff and everyone else was wonderful. It was just the Guest Relations staff who continued to try and get more and more money from us and lied about the conditions of surrounding beaches so we wouldn’t realize it was just this area that was bad.

Beautiful resort by the beach. Compare other review elsewhere, experience-wise i mean, it turns out it’s not as bad as i thought. 1 thing that wow me is i was unexpectedly received a word from a staff (her name is Isabel) after i wrote my initial feedback after i checked-in the resort. after Isabel reached out to me, she assisted me the rest of my stay & it was a wonderful experience. I could not thank her more on that.

Although i had tried to take an advantage to use most of the amenities as i could, however there was 1 minor mishap on my first night & i did not bring that up to Isabel. I used the hot tub for a bath. I thought the tub was fully safe. It turned out after i drained the water, the tub surroundings appeared to have some leakage that caused minor flooding in the room. The marble floor is too visible to note water around, & i slipped myself & my right arm got a little pain. I almost used up all the towels in the room in order to dry up the floor. It was a frightening situation & got me to avoid to use the tub again (although i wanted use it again). Hopefully my experience I’ve shared that the management would be aware on the tub situation on every single room because i do not want others who stays at the resort got into the same thing as i did. 

Overall, the experience in this resort is beyond than i expected. The staffs are very good host. Hopefully i would go back there again on my next visit.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,

Airport shuttle did not apply to our reservation. It’s for guests staying at The Grand or a certain VIP level, if I recall right. Very friendly & helpful staff. 
Believe all reviews about the beach — totally useless and smelly. I picked this resort more so for the pools, as we only do beach once during our vacation stays. Kids prefer to play in the pool more. 

Big Cons:
-The harassment of the sales staff. Upon arrival for check-in, attendant was pleasant and professional. As soon as we were checked in, the sales agent was waiting for us to discuss The Grand. Offered us free passes to go check it out and see if we’d like to basically do a membership, whatever you call it. I automatically said No, thank you. We reserved here and just want to eat after long day of travel and enjoy what we already have access to.  She persisted in trying to persuade me but I politely kept saying No, thanks.  Her coworker chimed in.Within minutes of entering our room, we got a call from another staff, promoting The Grand, again. No, thanks. Next morning, another call. I had to request they stop insisting
-Lack of elevators in close proximity of rooms. I requested balcony so we were placed on the last floor, and I loved the view but we still had a toddler on a stroller and closest elevator to our room was quite a walk away, so my husband had to carry the stroller down the closest stairs each time.

Overall, great stay! I was disappointed that the ocean was not blue like it was advertised but that’s not really the hotels fault.

There aren't many ways to avoid this on East-facing beaches right now so just be expecting this in most places. The beach however, is clean and we played volleyball for hours. 

The activity pool is great. We spent much of our time there. Food is great and the staff take great care of you and always have a smile.

System forces you to stay in your room from 10 am to 5 pm to make a call to reserve the seat for up to 2 days ahead.  This means if you go to the pool, go for a day trip or are simply not in your room for a short time after 10 am, you are not getting any reservation for those restaurants.  Making a call later on is a waste of time as everything is booked quickly.  As my family did a lot of travel and we stayed at the pool and the beach, we had to use the buffet restaurant (very limited selections of food offerings) and some lower quality restaurants that do not require reservation.  I wish they took some of the all the employees that are hassling you to purchase more vacations from them right after the check in and check out (feels like time-share sales approach) and have them fill in as extra help to allow earlier call time or simply had some people throughout the hotel to take dinner reservations in person.  It is sad and disappointing to see that spending $7,000 for a family of 4 does not get you the better restaurants or at least it is set up to get the reservation very difficult.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children",,,

Literally three staff took turns to try to convince us. It was a tiring experience. Most other staff are very nice. Food was good but not great. We stayed at Sunrise resort and was only a mexican buffet and one american buffet for breakfast, lunch. Chinese food a Momo’s was a big disappointment, we ordered almost everything on meal because most food was awful, almost taste like reheatable frozen food and sushi was not fresh at all. Only flank steak was edible. We didnt try the teppanyaki, which would be a better choice. Other restaurants were better tho. Cannot use $120 resort credit on many things, except photo or spa.

Mainly stayed at Nizuc and there were more than enough restaurants and pool entertainment/snacks to keep us busy but we did enjoy the option of going to Sunrise.The rooms are so comfortable that we had to fight to get up and explore the resort. No problems with premium alcohol requests, would have been nice to have fun drink menus/options listed to try new options on vacation. Many complain that the resort is huge but a simple 15 minute walk was not overwhelming to us. We are New Yorkers though so we are used to it. We would definitely visit again. Only thing we did not like was the wifi which was difficult to stream on and how hard it was to find open chairs around the pool because so many request towels and leave them there for hours.

Golf carts were obtained for our group of friends which made it easier to get to and from. The pool was well maintained. Only warning I can give is guests would throw towels on chairs at 6 in the morning and wouldn’t come out until noon. So unfortunately if you’re out at the pool earlier than those guests (a lot of them did this), you wouldn’t have a chair. Poolside service was amazing! Please tip your waitresses ! Very hot job . The beach wasn’t the most picturesque but the sand was unbelievably soft. I could go on and on. Overall it was a very enjoyable stay with my group of friends.

BRING YOUR OWN MUG and get someone to fill it up, or else you get these tiny tiny dixie cups of coffee. We liked the dance shows and had a great excursion to see sea turtles, cenote, private beach.

Even though we were promised 3 rooms for our 3 families to be together at Sunrise - they put one family at Nizuc. Then took so long to organize us all together at Nizuc. The front desk staff were HORRIBLE and did not care about us or making us happy at all. Their only repetitive answer to ALL/ANY of our questions was “NO”.  They have no concept of customer satisfaction.  When we asked about events, booking dinners or other amenities they would only tell us to “check the APP” and would not give us an answer. The problem is, the APP would never load because the WIFI was not sufficient for such a huge resort. They also have a membership program so if you pay into some kind of time share you move up in status… so everything we asked for- we were told was only for their “Diamond or Platinum” guests!  The resort totally over booked itself and the amount of people was insane!!!  One night we couldn’t even get into a restaurant and had to eat our outdoor buffet standing on the patio stairs.  Finally, the ocean is not swimmable- it’s brown and dirty.  We came from Canada to enjoy the blue water… you will not get that at this resort.  Saying all that- I must include that the bar and restaurant staff were always lovely and worked very hard!

Great for that only. Beach is deserted and nobody in the water looked gross and perhaps dangerous. Nothing for nightime entertainment except for the nightclub. Service is 5 star quality. Pools are great, although a maze to get around. You have to pay extra for a day pass to go to the grand. Room service is included and is top notch and quick. All of the bars close early :/ and they don't tell you if you are at Nizuc or sunrise until arrival. Most excursions are far and make sure that transportation is included of booking otherwise your paying like out of pocket which is expensive.

I think a total of 6 different people tried to get us to buy into the resort. It was very distasteful and high pressured. There was also a concert going on that we did not know about and it was very noisy at night and they also tore down the stage after the concert by our room.

The Good: Very nice place to stay, comfortable, clean, quite but still plenty of entertainment and water activities,  amazing options as far as food and drinks go and the people there would go above and beyond for us so they were ALL simply amazing!

The Bad: This is our 3rd time going there and now some changes have affected the All-Inclusive. Some food dishes and most of the wine bottles are no longer included there is also added cost to access amenities at the Grand plus no longer shuttle service to sister ""Beach Palace"" hotel in the  hotel zone where there is a better beach to enjoy the ocean. The cab there will now run you approx $60.00 dollars round trip.

This hotel (we stayed at Nizuc) is absolutely amazing. Beautiful rooms, beautiful property and pools. One pool out of all of them is heated which was really nice. Whats makes this plase absolutely incredible are employees. They are all over, helping you before you even know you need help. They are the most hardworking and fast working friendly people we have met in the hotels. You can visit other Palace hotels where your all inclusive applies as well. Covid tests are free and you get result within 5 minutes. Everything is very official. Transport between hotels - The Grand and Sunrise is provided. To other hotels like The Beach Palace you need to take taxi ($28). If you are sick of your selection of food (only three restaurants at Nizuc) you can go to Sunrise (5 minutes away) and they have many more different restaurants. Beach is unswimable all year round. It doesnt get better. For beach we went to The Beach hotel. But teh pools are incredible. Kids Club is great and beautiful and smells like bubble gum.  Room service was very fast as well. This is definitely one of the properties I would come back to.

I previously had Covid and since I work from home I didn’t feel it was necessary to speak with a doctor since I had no symptoms. I stayed at home and quarantined per the CDC. At the resort i tested positive and my boyfriend tested negative so they made us pack up our room and moved us to a remote part of the property. The room they moved us to had a cockroach in the bed and other black bugs. They ended our vacation a night early and only let us order room service. They wouldn’t give me another test until the next morning, the day we were suppose to leave. We lost our day pass that we had for the Grand and all of our reservations for the last night. I told them I wanted to take a new test since something was wrong but they wouldn’t let me. No one else on the entire resort was in quarantine which is pretty hard to imagine since the resort was filled. They finally gave me a new test around 10 am the next morning and shockingly it was negative!! So my last night on vacation was completely ruined and they gave me nothing in compensation. I came home and have tested negative for the past 4 days since flying home. What a disgrace. I guess they needed to make their Covid quota for the day and I was unfortunately their 1 positive case. I know that’s the risk we took by going out of the country but they were not accommodating at all.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Amenities, property conditions & facilities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Cleanliness, staff & service","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with partner",,,

Everything was in good condition and well maintained, the kids had a great time, everything was good.  The app wasn't working during our stay which would've made planning dinners easier, but was a minor issue.

Two minor annoyances:
1. After checking in, they ask you to register with customer service.  This turns into a relatively low pressure sales pitch to attend a higher pressure sales presentation for their vacation club.  Not a big deal, but found out later from other guests instead of 90 minutes it was a 4 hr session, thankfully I didn't attend.
2.  On checkout, they advised my resort credit wasn't applied since I didn't register with customer service.  I explained that even though I didn't know about the resort credit, I had registered anyhow.  I was tired from a long vacation and not in the mood to argue over $120, but it was a sour note to end an otherwise great trip.",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children",,,

Besides giving us the wrong rooms and not telling us about it before we went there, long line and nobody answers the phone, were on hold twice about 40 minutes until I hang up, could be longer.
That day my daughter almost died from allergic reaction from eating a wholemeal bread that had apparently too many seeds and nuts that weren't visible. Thanks God we had epipen and ambulance came after asking for help and urging them to come quick. We were checking in at 3 pm and came back at 1 am from the Hospital.
At the hotel they ask at the restaurant if you have any allergies, but later nobody knows very well what is i the food. It takes a long wait time to find out something and they are not sure. There was only one pool that has warm water, the rest of them were painfully cold to enter. I never went to the hotel with that temperature cold water, cenote water was slightly warmer! Played mini golf and got dozen bites immediately! My daughter's room was full of mold and we have asked to clean, they said it was cleaned, but still looked moldy and it was hard to sleep. 
Food was good but not great, drinks are ok, beach is not swimmable, brown water. Shows are very good.

Access to our hotel and Nizuc was great and the amount of golf carts and buses to get back and forth was very nice. Loved the bikes and mini golf. Grounds were beautiful. Room was clean and constantly refreshed. Nice to see again. 
My issues…the beach. Yuck. I mean seaweed and garbage up on shore. The water is dirty looking and the sand felt like mush. They are constantly cleaning it but our first day it was not and the water is never clear. 
I’d give the food 3/5 stars. It was ok. Breakfast options were terrible. Never went to Grand, maybe that’s where the massive buffet was…not our hotel. My kids barely touched anything for breakfast…and they aren’t super picky. I’ve eaten better at other hotels and have seen much better buffet options. 

Kids were never bored which is nice and the hotel is beautiful. Food and beach would be my only issues. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family and small children",,,

Also their check-in experience was a nightmare.  It took over 90 minutes for us to simply check in.

But I still recommend this property.  And the Mayan Experience Excursion was the best!  I highly recommend it.  The pools were very nice and the beach is beautiful.  They even have a net in the water keeping the seaweed out.  I have heard of other places being swamped with seaweed.

She had email confirmation and the resort could not show where she canceled or obtained a refund. Very poor customer service from management on. Next I discovered small  black ants in my room later that night and I noticed our air wasn't working properly. I was so tired I didn't get a chance to speak with guest services until the next night but I didn't want anyone in our room while we were out for an excursion. No one never got back with us.

However, what’s shiny isn’t always a diamond. This was the case for this resort. The people that worked there were rude and always seemed to have an attitude for simple questions asked. It was our first time at this resort but 6th time visiting Cancun. We were told one thing at check in and when we tried to do what they told us, they said it wasn’t true. It was always back and forth with the staff. I asked for a straw for a mudslide drink I ordered, they said they didn’t have any but could see a cup of straws behind the bar. The food was cold and dry at most of the restaurants. We even had hair in our tacos and when we told the server they said nothing but that we could get more. My mom slipped and fell outside, her wrist and arm were super swollen, she asked for pills or something that would help, and they said she had to pay for everything. We filed a report since there were no signs that said “wet or slippery”, and they immediately tried to have her sign a release of claim form. When we refused to sign it, the following day they offered medicine. Which could have been offered the first day when she asked for it. We also ordered room service and my husbands eggs were raw when we ordered them over hard, when we called to tell them, they didn’t care or bothered to offer new ones. 
My husband tried to talk to the general manager and everyone kept telling us that we couldn’t talk to him. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Property conditions & facilities","ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Staff & service","",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

What we didn't like: Beach is terrible. However, you can take a taxi ($28 each way) and spend the day at Beach Palace where the beach and water are perfect! The buffet is sub-par compared to other resorts we've been to. For the most part, the membership sales staff is ok.

As you well know, there is a large number of hotels to choose from, and I can imagine that after years of travel, all of them generally tend to provide the same thing: relaxation, sun, and an average abundance.

We stayed at Sunrise and this was the best for a young family.  We could park ourselves at the pool near the kid pool and have an adult pool next to it with a bar. Our child is 4 and loved it.   We also would shuttle over to Nizuc for the big slide.   They also have child care which we didn't do but after checking it out, I would've.  As far as the restaurants and buffets, MOMO was our favorite.  It was a Japanese hibachi grill.  Food was great and completely entertained our child.  
As far as improvements, we were a little upset at check in.  The line wasn't very long but it took forever. Before we even had our room, the concierge was trying to upsell us to Moon Palace and we hadn't even seen Sunrise yet. Sounds much like a time share pitch.

The property is huge with lots of amenities, but you aren’t allowed to do anything, like book a massage, until you “activate your checkin” after you’ve already checked in. These are known as “the green shirt guys”. They are the timeshare sales people who will stalk you. The website says you can have a free pass to The Grand but they won’t give it to you unless you do a 2 hour time share talk. We had to lie and say we did it back in Dec. We didn’t do it in Dec because we were told by guests that it was 4 hours. This can really ruin a vacation. After we refused they called our room everyday to try and change our minds and they stopped letting us book dinner reservations. The pool was very big but very cold and has a horrific stench from the seaweed. It is so bad. It can really ruin your day. If you sit by the pool, sit as far away from the ocean as possible. The pool servers were amazing. Debrath, Sandra, and Olivia were wonderful!!! On a good day, the food is pretty average. They overcook everything: meats and seafood especially. You have to pay extra for steak and lobster if you want a good meal. The amenities are pretty great. They have a wonderful selection of pool activities and nighttime shows. The spa is very weak.

Check in lady argued with me that I hadn’t read the terms and conditions, which she then attempted to read.   Failed.  Wasting my precious time.   Then she told me to contact Expedia myself to sort it out.  Which was infuriating.  How is this my problem to resolve at all?  Then she told me to go to guest services, and they’d help me.   But guest services is only there to sell you time shares at a nearby property. And even when I told that lady I wasn’t interested, she continued to talk over me about tour times at the nearby property, rather than listening to me about my credit and upgrade issue.  WHICH AGAIN WERE WRITTEN IN MY RESERVATION.   When she finally stopped talking, she said, oh, I can’t help you with that.  You need to talk to Public Relations.  Again mentioned that I should call Expedia.   Utter nonsense that this was made my problem to solve at all.     So I walked over a few metres to Public Relations, who said they’d look into it and call me.  Total time wasted approximately an hour.  I was only staying for a day and half.   Utter nonsense.  And profoundly offensive that guest services was actually nothing of the sort.  Just a trick to get you to spend several hours looking at the time shares they’re trying to unload.

We did the Grand tour. Which is a sister property. Once they threw every sales person at us and still didn’t make the sale they were no longer interested in us. The property is several hundred acres. They wined and dined is getting there and in the end they literally left us without a guide or transportation back to our hotel. No direction nothing.

A golf cart took us to our room. Expect to walk a lot here since the property is big which is good since you may eat a lot. A golf cart can take you where you need to go to save a walk if you catch them.  The food was great especially in El Manglar and Agra. The room was clean and fridge was stocked at all times. 
My only complaint is the Sales people in green shirts in the lobby. They constantly harass you to book an excursion or a 90 minute tour at the Grand hotel. They just cannot take no for an answer. It’s annoying to be harassed while on vacation but just say no and walk away.

In addition, there nothing really to do in resort. No entertainment during the day near pool or any other areas. Additional cost for using sauna and steam room even for all-inclusive customers, unless purchase any spa package. Average food quality, impossible to make a reservation for diner with resort app. and it takes very long time to make it over the phone. To get the free shuttle you'd have to waste time on the phone again, arranging the shuttle, then get transferred and put on hold indefinitely.  Staff looks friendly. You would think that they are willing to help, but in reality, do nothing. Pool tables located in the bar and bar is open at 5:30PM. Go figure how to entertain yourself during rainy morning. Pool staff will treat you right only if you tip them. No tips, no attention. Constant sales pitch during whole stay. It looks like the resort staff is disparate to sell you vacation packages in one way or another. You would have to pay for simple medical attention, like get water out of the ear and nurse is not there on Sunday. Free COVID testing is also not available on Sunday. I mentioned all inconveniences above in person to the customer service and they all just acted like it is what it is.

Because the app doesn't always give a clear layout.  2) The sales efforts of pushing for an upgrade during check-in, and sales pitches of time shares right after is a turn-off. Especially when we didn't even get a chance to go to our room yet. Also, the daily morning calls to wake up up and try to sell memberships is a bad move.  

Other than these, the resort is wonderful. Just do some research before going so not everything is a surprise. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with family",,,

Moverte, el camión que hay entre lobbys, tiendas, amenidades etc. Los restaurantes de buffet están bien, todo tipo de comida pero no espectacular. La recepción del Sunrise es ideal para la gente con niños. Las albercas son incontables y no existe el problema de otros hoteles que la gente baja a apartar los camastros sin usarlos, aunque estaba lleno siempre había lugar, aunque faltan sombrillas en algunas. Las bebidas que ofrecen en todos los bares son de primera, el vino de la casa bastante decente. El restaurante Momo que es Thai muy bueno. Aquí puedes pedir todo lo de la carta que es muy extenso; en casi todos los all inclusive te dan a escoger una sola entrada, y dos platos, aquí puedes pedir de todo y las veces que quieras. Creo que aquí si deberían darte a escoger un plato por tiempo pues al final la gente pide demasiado y desperdicia. El restaurante brasileño de espadas bastante malito, los cortes casi sin sabor. Tiene un kiosko donde sirven café, postres y sándwiches todo el día que es una maravilla. Las pizzas de la alberca son espectaculares. No hubo tiempo de pedir room service pero se veía muy bien. Es indispensable bajar la aplicación del hotel al llegar para conocer todos los servicios. El 95% de la gente muy amable y servicial, alguno ya cansado no tanto pero se entiende y a la salida te ofrecen súper descuentos para que regreses",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"Excelente hotel, gigantesco !

Me tocó una habitación con la coladera de la regadera tapada, por lo que no podíamos bañarnos sin que se rebosara la regadera, muy incómodo tener que llamar para destaparlo, el chico saco la bola de pelos y la aventó a la taza, dejando ahí la suciedad de huéspedes anteriores, todo salpicado y enlodado. Nuevamente hubo que llamar y solicitar limpieza y desinfección, no se tuvo acceso al baño en más de 2 horas en lo que se atendía la situación. Ellos mismos te canalizan al departamento de relaciones públicas para escuchar lo sucedido, sin embargo te recibe gente sin la capacidad y cualidades necesarias para conciliar, en específico mencionó a Aarón Romero quien grosero y poco amable no hizo más que empeorar la situación con su trato carente de educación.

The property is super huge, way bigger than you may think especially when you take into account all three of the moon palace resorts (sunrise, nizuc  and the grand) that are next to each other. Massive pools with many bars serving great drinks and super friendly staff. 

However, my favourite thing about moon palace sunrise were all the amazing restaurants one can dine at. One of my favourites was Agra, the Indian restaurant where we were greeted and seated by Flor, a very friendly and accommodating hostess. Our waiter Manuel was super kind and funny and answered any questions we had about the menu since my partner and I are not very familiar with Indian cuisine. The food was out of this world, immense flavour and beautiful presentations with all their dishes. Agra was the only restaurant we visited more than once! I wish I remembered the names of all the hosts and servers at all the places we ate at because every single one of them was great! I believe Carol was the name of our server during our first visit at Agra, who stood out with her very friendly and comforting service which together with the amazing food made us want to come to Agra again. 

We had breakfast everyday at La Gondola at their international buffet and it was astounding to me that the waiters always knew exactly when to refill our coffees before we even had to ask. Amazing. 

To conclude: I would definitely recommend it. ",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_4","Liked: Cleanliness, staff & service, amenities, property conditions & facilities",,,,,"",,,,,,,,,"Traveled with partner",,,

Was mediocre but in the back with pools and restaurants was excellent. This resort only cares about their diamond and tiered levels of members. Us vip members weren’t cared for and we were treated way differently. Way too big of a resort. Wouldn’t recommend it or come back.

The reservation did not specify which site was booked. I stayed the Sunset location. It was not luxurious like the Grand location. Make sure that you get clarity before booking. Upon check in, there was no description from the reception desk about the hotel and amenities.  She probably told Upon me that I would receive an email with an app but I could not hear anything over the loud band playing in the lobby.  Instead of a room key, they give you a wrist band to get in the room. The room was so far from the main lobby that I had to be transported by golf cart. The room was humid and  the bedding was moist as a result. The room smelled very strong of disinfectant.  It was very hard to be comfortable. I did not feel especially safe either.

I can say this is by far the worst hotel. If you want to pay for a old, totally overpriced hotel, with incapable staff and warm beer, this is your spot... Let me share my 3-day experience: It was impossible to get a single seat at the beach or pools. Tons of families were sharing the same seats to avoid leaving their stuff on the floor. There were no towels at all. When I complainted, they offered my a day pass to Grand Palace. It was a scam! I spent 3 hours listening to a super aggresive sales speach for the vacactional club. Once I get my day passes (after screaming to the PR ladies for 45 min), I went to the beach, where there were no empty seats and NO FOOD. It was impossible to get any kind of food or drinks at this 5-diamond resort. I also received credits for the Spa, but my wife couldn't book a massage because the system was down. Instead we went to the playroom, which had a massive  leakage and we had to get out inmediatly. Last, but not least, the average waiting time to get a drink was 45 min, and all I could get was warm beer. Obviously they didn't have any other more sofisticated drinks like apperol spritz... The staff was absolutely overpassed so no one was able to help. Food is not bad, if you are lucky enough to book a restaurant, or if you are willing to wait 30-45 minutes to get a burger or a hot dog with no bread at the pool (but don't ask ketchup because there is not).

En los toboganes de The Grand, los chicos del grupo de Salvavidas también siempre atentos a apoyar y brindar un servicio y atención excelente. Perla en recepción, muy amable.

El servicio del restaurante bugambilias es muy bueno, el desayuno es bastante agradable y la atención del señor Juventino fue genial.
Quiero reconocer especialmente al personal del restaurante Góndola porque ellos salvaron nuestro día en la cena, les comentamos que celebrábamos el cumpleaños de nuestra hija y se ocuparon a la perfección de hacer un súper detalle, Alexis en la recepción del restaurante se encargó de ayudarnos con esta parte, Eduardo y Arturo nos proporcionaron una atención de primera y ayudaron a olvidarnos de la mala experiencia que hasta ahora habíamos tenido, muchas gracias por ello a todos en el restaurante se llevan un 11 de calificación.
Lo malo: El check in es muy lento, no se preocupan por asignar habitaciones (cuando reservas más de una) en el mismo edificio al menos, la movilidad interna es complicada, el lobby está muy lejos de los demás edificios, el segundo día llovió por la mañana y se nos inundó completamente la habitación, nunca llegó nadie a ayudarnos a sacar nuestras cosas y no nos ofrecieron cambiarnos de habitación hasta que nos vieron muy molestos.Nos llevaron a una plática donde nos trataron muy mal por no querer comprarles una membresía, en fin no volvería",,"ReviewThemes","Icon","sentiment_2","Disliked: Cleanliness, amenities",,,,,"",,"PropertyReviewTranslationInfo","Loading translation...","See original",,"Mark","Translated by Google","Translate with Google","Traveled with family and small children","Traveled with family",,
