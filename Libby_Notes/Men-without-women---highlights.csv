"September 04, 2023 20:04",Men Without Women,97.6%,#FFB,"When I listen to this music I feel like I’m in a wide-open, empty place. It’s a vast space, with nothing to close it off. No walls, no ceiling. I don’t need to think, don’t need to say anything, or do anything. Just being there is enough. I close my eyes and give myself up to the beautiful strings. There’re no headaches, no sensitivity to cold, no periods, or ovulation. Everything is simply beautiful, peaceful, flowing. I can just be"
"September 04, 2023 19:47",Men Without Women,96.8%,#FFB,"It’s quite easy to become Men Without Women. You love a woman deeply, and then she goes off somewhere. That’s all it takes. Most of the time (as I’m sure you’re well aware) it’s crafty sailors who take them away. They sweet-talk them into going with them, then carry them off to Marseilles or the Ivory Coast. And there’s hardly anything we can do about it. Or else the women have nothing to do with sailors, and take their own lives. And there’s very little we can do about that, too. Not even the sailors can do a thing."
"September 04, 2023 19:45",Men Without Women,96.8%,#FFB,"After that, every time I pass the statue of the unicorn, I sit down there for a while and contemplate Men Without Women. Why that place? Why a unicorn? Maybe the unicorn, too, is one of the Men Without Women. I mean, I’ve never seen a unicorn couple. He—it has to be a he, right?—is always alone, sharp horn thrust toward the sky. Maybe we should adopt him as the symbol of Men Without Women, of the loneliness we carry as our burden. Perhaps we should sew unicorn badges on our breast pockets and hats, and quietly parade down streets all over the world. No music, no flags, no tickertape. Probably. (I’m using the word “probably” a bit too much. Probably.)"
"September 04, 2023 18:56",Men Without Women,96.0%,#FFB,"Suddenly one day you become Men Without Women. That day comes to you completely out of the blue, without the faintest of warnings or hints beforehand. No premonitions or foreboding, no knocks or clearing of throats. Turn a corner and you know you’re already there. But by then there’s no going back. Once you round that bend, that is the only world you can possibly inhabit. In that world you are called “Men Without Women.” Always a relentlessly frigid plural"
"September 04, 2023 18:56",Men Without Women,96.0%,#FFE0EC,"Only Men Without Women can comprehend how painful, how heartbreaking, it is to become one. You lose that wonderful west wind. Fourteen is stolen away from you forever. (A billion years should count as forever.) The far-off, weary lament of the sailors. The bottom of the sea, with the ammonites and coelacanths. Calling someone’s house past one a.m. Getting a call after one a.m. from a stranger. Waiting for someone you don’t know somewhere between knowledge and ignorance. Tears falling on the dry road as you check the pressure of your tires"
"September 03, 2023 22:48",Men Without Women,95.2%,#FFB,"I wish there was a machine that could accurately measure sadness, and display it in numbers that you could record. And it would be great if that machine could fit in the palm of your hand. I think of this every time I measure the air in my tires."
"September 03, 2023 22:43",Men Without Women,94.4%,#FFE0EC,"My despair was deeper than any ocean that they might have crossed. Deeper than any sea where giant squid and sea dragons swam. I started to hate myself. I couldn’t believe in anything. How the hell had this happened? That’s how much I loved M, how much she meant to me. How much I needed her. Why had I ever looked away?"
"September 01, 2023 14:28",Samsa in Love,91.1%,#FFB,Maybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart.”
"August 30, 2023 13:55",Kino,79.8%,#FFB,"When I should have felt real pain, I stifled it. I didn’t want to take it on, so I avoided facing up to it. Which is why my heart is so empty now. The snakes have grabbed that spot and are trying to hide their coldly beating hearts there."
"August 30, 2023 13:55",Kino,79.8%,#FFB,"Even if he ran to the far corners of the earth and stuffed his ears full of clay, as long as he was still alive, as long as he had a shred of consciousness remaining, those knocks would relentlessly track him down. It wasn’t a knocking on a door in a business hotel. It was a knocking on the door to his heart. A person couldn’t escape that sound"
"August 29, 2023 14:08",Kino,76.6%,#FFB,you’re not the type who would willingly do something wrong. I know that very well. But there are times in this world when it’s not enough just not to do the wrong thing. Some people use that blank space as a kind of loophole
"August 28, 2023 13:52",Kino,68.5%,#FFB,"In his life, after all, he had achieved nothing, had been totally unproductive. He couldn’t make anyone else happy, and, of course, couldn’t make himself happy. Happiness? He wasn’t even sure what that meant. He didn’t have a clear sense, either, of emotions like pain or anger, disappointment or resignation, and how they were supposed to feel. The most he could do was create a place where his heart—devoid now of any depth or weight—could be tethered, to keep it from wandering aimlessly"
"August 27, 2023 23:09",Scheherazade,64.5%,#FFB,"But there was another possibility. He could be deprived of his freedom entirely, in which case not only Scheherazade but all women might be taken away from him. It was a very real prospect. Never again would he be able to enter the warm moistness of their bodies. Never again would he feel them quiver in response. Perhaps an even more distressing prospect for Habara than the cessation of sexual activity, however, was the loss of the moments of shared intimacy. To lose all contact with women was, in the end, to lose that connection. What his time spent with women offered was the opportunity to be embraced by reality, on the one hand, while negating it entirely on the other. That was something Scheherazade had provided in abundance—indeed, her gift was inexhaustible. The prospect of losing that made him saddest of all."
"August 27, 2023 23:03",Scheherazade,63.7%,#FFB,"Life is strange, isn’t it? You can be totally entranced by the glow of something one minute, be willing to sacrifice everything to make it yours, but then a little time passes, or your perspective changes a bit, and all of a sudden you’re shocked at how faded it appears"
"August 26, 2023 17:46",Scheherazade,53.2%,#FFB," matter what sort of story it was, she made it special. Her voice, her timing, her pacing were all flawless"
"August 26, 2023 17:46",Scheherazade,53.2%,#FFE0EC,"She captured her listener’s attention, tantalized him, drove him to ponder and speculate, and then, in the end, gave him precisely what he’d been seeking"
"August 26, 2023 17:41",An Independent Organ,51.6%,#FFB,I’m a little envious of the way he loved one woman—putting aside what sort of woman she was—so deeply that it made him want to reduce himself to nothing
"August 26, 2023 17:41",An Independent Organ,51.6%,#FFB,"It feels like somehow our hearts have become intertwined. Like when she feels something, my heart moves in tandem. Like we’re two boats tied together with rope. Even if you want to cut the rope, there’s no knife sharp enough to do it."
"August 26, 2023 17:34",An Independent Organ,51.6%,#FFB,"Women are all born with a special, independent organ that allows them to lie. This was Dr. Tokai’s personal opinion"
"August 26, 2023 17:34",An Independent Organ,51.6%,#FFB,"It depends on the person, he said, about the kind of lies they tell, what situation they tell them in, and how the lies are told. But at a certain point in their lives, all women tell lies, and they lie about important things. They lie about unimportant things, too, but they also don’t hesitate to lie about the most important things. And when they do, most women’s expressions and voices don’t change at all, since it’s not them lying, but this independent organ they’re equipped with that’s acting on its own. That’s why—except in a few special cases—they can still have a clear conscience and never lose sleep over anything they say."
"August 26, 2023 17:23",An Independent Organ,50.8%,#FFE0EC,"Mr. Tanimura, I know this is an imposition, but I have a favor to ask. Please remember Dr. Tokai. He had such a pure heart. I think that what we can do for those who’ve passed on is keep them in our memories as long as we can. But it’s not as easy as it sounds. I can’t ask just anyone to do that"
"August 26, 2023 17:17",An Independent Organ,50.0%,#FFB,"If that woman had told him ‘I decided I can’t leave my husband and child, so I have to break up with you,’ then I think he could have stood it. He loved her more than he had ever loved anybody before, so of course he would have been devastated, but I doubt it would have driven him to death. As long as it all makes sense, no matter how deep you fall, you should be able to pull yourself together again. But the appearance of a third man, and the realization that he’d been used, was a shock he couldn’t recover from.”"
"August 25, 2023 13:53",An Independent Organ,46.8%,#FFB,"Definitely not rage directed at her. But when I haven’t seen her for a while, when I can’t see her, I feel that rage welling up. I can’t grasp, though, what it’s about. But it’s the most intense anger I’ve ever felt before"
"August 24, 2023 17:42",An Independent Organ,46.0%,#FFB,"it was unclear what future this woman and I have, and the combination gave me a mild case of middle-aged depression. Who in the world am I? I’ve been incessantly asking myself this. But no matter how much I ask, I can’t find an answer. I just keep going around in circles. Things that I used to enjoy I now find boring. I don’t feel like exercising, or buying clothes. It’s too much trouble to sit down at the piano anymore. I don’t even feel much like eating. I just sit there and think about her. Even when I’m with a client, my mind’s full of her. I’m afraid I might even blurt out her name.”"
"August 24, 2023 14:50",An Independent Organ,44.4%,#FFB,"The deep sense of loss after you’ve met the woman you love, have made love, then said goodbye. Like you’re suffocating. The same emotion hasn’t changed at all in a thousand years"
"August 24, 2023 14:50",An Independent Organ,44.4%,#FFB,"If you took away my career as a plastic surgeon, and the happy environment I’m living in, and threw me out into the world, with no explanation, and with everything stripped away—what in the world would I be?”"
"August 24, 2023 14:44",An Independent Organ,43.5%,#FFE0EC,"We’re still trying to find opportunities to see each other. But who knows about the future. She’s afraid that her husband will find out about us, and she said she may stop seeing me someday. And maybe he will find out and we really will have to stop seeing each other. Or maybe she’ll simply get tired of our affair. I have no idea what tomorrow will bring.”"
"August 24, 2023 14:44",An Independent Organ,43.5%,#FFB,"As with most people who are well raised, well educated, and financially secure, Dr. Tokai only thought of himself. But in spite of all this, as previously mentioned, he was a wonderful conversationalist and I really enjoyed talking with him"
"August 24, 2023 14:44",An Independent Organ,43.5%,#FFB,"Having seen my love now / and said farewell / I know how very shallow my heart was of old / as if I had never before known love,’ ” Tokai intoned"
"August 23, 2023 14:16",An Independent Organ,42.7%,#FFB,have you ever tried really hard not to love somebody too much
"August 23, 2023 14:16",An Independent Organ,42.7%,#FFB,"It’s simple, really. If I love her too much, it’s painful. I can’t take it. I don’t think my heart can stand it, which is why I’m trying not to fall in love with her.”"
"August 23, 2023 14:16",An Independent Organ,42.7%,#FFB,"But it all boils down to intentionally thinking negative thoughts about her as much as I can. I mentally list as many of her defects as I can come up with—her imperfections, I should say. And I repeat these over and over in my head like a mantra, convincing myself not to love this woman more than I should.”"
"August 23, 2023 14:16",An Independent Organ,42.7%,#FFB,"First of all, I couldn’t come up with many negative things about her. And there’s the fact that I find even those negative qualities attractive. And another thing is I can’t tell myself what’s too much for me, and what isn’t. This is the first time in my life I’ve ever had these kind of senseless feelings.”"
"August 23, 2023 14:16",An Independent Organ,42.7%,#FFB,"A time when thinking about a certain person made my chest ache and I couldn’t think of anything else…But this was a one-sided feeling that didn’t go anywhere. Things are different now. I’m an adult, and we actually have a physical relationship. Even so, my mind’s a total mess. The more I think about her, the more it’s actually affecting me physically, my internal organs. Especially my digestive and respiratory systems.”"
"August 23, 2023 14:13",An Independent Organ,41.9%,#FFB,"He issues three key pieces of advice: take your time and don’t force things; don’t fall into predictable patterns; and when you do have to lie, make sure to keep it simple. (This was, of course, like trying to teach a seagull how to fly, but he made sure of it, just the same.)"
"August 23, 2023 14:08",An Independent Organ,41.1%,#FFB,"In this huge world there are some beautiful, happy families where parents and children maintain a close, warm relationship—a situation about as frequent as hat tricks in soccer. I have no confidence at all that I could be one of these rare happy parents, and can’t see Tokai doing it either."
"August 23, 2023 14:08",An Independent Organ,41.1%,#FFB,"I would call Tokai an affable person. He wasn’t a poor loser, had no inferiority complex or jealousy, no excessive biases or pride, no particular obsessions, wasn’t overly sensitive, had no steadfast political views. On the surface, at least, he had none of the traits you would associate with an unstable personality. The people around him loved his straightforward, frank personality, his polished manners, and his cheerful, positive attitude. And Tokai aimed these qualities mainly at women—half of the world’s population—in a strategic, effective way. Kindness and consideration for women were, for someone in his profession, necessary skills, and Tokai possessed them naturally—they were innate, inborn qualities, like a lovely voice or long fingers. Because of this (and, of course, because he was a talented surgeon), his clinic did a booming business. He never advertised, yet his appointment schedule was always full"
"August 23, 2023 14:08",An Independent Organ,41.1%,#FFE0EC,", affable people like this are most often shallow, mediocre, and boring. Tokai, though, exhibited none of these qualities. I always enjoyed kicking back for an hour on weekends with him, having a couple of beers. He was an excellent conversationalist, with a wealth of topics. His sense of humor was always straightforward, never especially complex. He told me many interesting behind-the-scenes plastic surgery tales (always, of course, protecting the clients’ privacy), and he disclosed a number of fascinating facts about women. Never once, though, did he let these descend into vulgarity. He always spoke of his women friends with great respect and affection, and took care to keep any personal information secret."
"August 23, 2023 14:08",An Independent Organ,41.1%,#FFB,"“A gentleman doesn’t talk much about the taxes he paid, or the women he sleeps with"
"August 23, 2023 14:03",An Independent Organ,40.3%,#FFB,"In most cases the decision to get married came just before they were about to turn thirty, or forty. Just like calendars that sell well at the end of the year"
"August 23, 2023 14:03",An Independent Organ,40.3%,#FFB,"Congratulations on your marriage,” he’d tell her. “You’re such an intelligent, charming, lovely woman. I hope you are truly happy—you deserve to be.” And he really felt this way. These women had shared a precious portion of their lives with him and, out of what he hoped was genuine affection, provided him with some warm and wonderful times. For that alone he was grateful. What more could he ask of them?"
"August 23, 2023 14:03",An Independent Organ,40.3%,#FFB,They selfishly were convinced that everyone else in the world should be obliged to suffer the way they did.
"August 23, 2023 13:57",An Independent Organ,39.5%,#FFB,"Tokai just hoped that when he was with a woman, she thought only of him. What she did or thought outside of their time together was her own business, not something for him to speculate about. Meddling in their lives outside the confines of their affair was out of the question"
"August 23, 2023 13:57",An Independent Organ,39.5%,#FFB,"Personally, I think most women in the world (particularly the really attractive ones) are fed up with men who are always panting to get them into bed."
"August 23, 2023 13:57",An Independent Organ,39.5%,#FFB,"What he valued instead were bright, quick-witted women with a sense of humor. If a woman was very beautiful but had nothing to say, or no opinions of her own, Tokai became discouraged"
"August 23, 2023 13:57",An Independent Organ,39.5%,#FFB,"No operation could ever improve a woman’s intellectual skills. Having a pleasant conversation over dinner with an intelligent woman, or lingering over small talk while holding one another in bed—these were the moments he treasured."
"August 22, 2023 14:15",Yesterday,37.1%,#FFB,"Music has that power to revive memories, sometimes so intensely that they hurt."
"August 22, 2023 14:15",Yesterday,37.1%,#FFE0EC,"But when I look back at myself at age twenty, what I remember most is being alone and lonely. I had no girlfriend to warm my body or my soul, no friends I could open up to. No clue what I should do every day, no vision for the future. For the most part, I remained hidden away, deep within myself. Sometimes I’d go a week without talking to anybody. That kind of life continued for a year. A long, long year. Whether this period was a cold winter that left valuable growth rings inside me, I can’t really say. "
"August 22, 2023 14:15",Yesterday,37.1%,#FFE0EC,"If it’s too much to ask that he’s happy, I hope at least that today he has his health, and all his needs met. For no one knows what kind of dreams tomorrow will bring."
"August 22, 2023 14:12",Yesterday,36.3%,#FFB,Dreams are the kind of things you can—when you need to—borrow and lend out
"August 22, 2023 13:56",Yesterday,31.5%,#FFB,"If you don’t know what you’re looking for, it’s not easy to look for it.”"
"August 22, 2023 13:56",Yesterday,31.5%,#FFB,"I truly love Aki-kun, and I don’t think I could ever feel the same way about anybody else. Whenever I’m away from him I get this terrible ache in my chest, always in the same spot. It’s true. There’s a place in my heart reserved just for him. But at the same time I have this strong urge inside me to try something else, to come into contact with all kinds of people. Call it curiosity, a thirst to know more. More possibilities. It’s a natural emotion and I can’t suppress it, no matter how much I try.”"
"August 21, 2023 14:03",Yesterday,29.8%,#FFB,"But maybe going through that kind of tough, lonely experience is necessary when you’re young? Part of the process of growing up?” 

“You think so?” 

“The way surviving hard winters makes a tree grow stronger, the growth rings inside it tighter.”"
"August 21, 2023 13:53",Yesterday,26.6%,#FFB,"It’s like, we graduate from college, get married, we’re this wonderful married couple everybody’s happy about, we have the typical two kids, put ’em in the good old Denenchofu elementary school, go out to the Tama River banks on Sundays, ‘Ob-la-di, ob-la-da’…I’m not saying that kinda life’s bad. But I wonder, y’know, if life should really be that easy, that comfortable. It might be better to go our separate ways for a while, and if we find out that we really can’t get along without each other, then we get back together.”"
"August 20, 2023 16:30",Drive My Car,21.0%,#FFB,"Leaving who one was for a brief time, then returning. But the self that one returned to was never exactly the same as the self that one had left behind."

"August 20, 2023 16:30",Drive My Car,20.2%,#FFB,"To me, it’s a kind of sickness. Thinking about it doesn’t do much good. The way my father walked out on my mother and me, my mother’s constant abuse—I blame the sickness for those things. There’s no logic involved. All I can do is accept what"
"August 20, 2023 00:00",Drive My Car,19.4%,#FFE0EC,"Tobacco’s a killer,” Kafuku said. 

“Being alive is a killer, if you think about it,” Misaki said."
"August 19, 2023 23:58",Drive My Car,18.5%,#FFE0EC,"Yet on this day, that thought did not suffocate him. Instead, his reaction was, yes, such things do happen. They do happen. After all, it’s just a matter of flesh and blood. No more than a pile of bone and ash in the end, right? There has to be something more important than that. 

If that’s what you wish to call it, then we men are all living with the same sort of blind spot"
"August 19, 2023 23:52",Drive My Car,17.7%,#FFB,"I don’t think we can ever understand all that a woman is thinking,” he said. “That’s what I wanted to say. No matter who that woman may be. So I doubt the blind spot you speak of is yours alone. If that’s what you wish to call it, then we men are all living with the same sort of blind spot. So I don’t think you should blame yourself.”"
"August 19, 2023 23:52",Drive My Car,17.7%,#FFB,"But the proposition that we can look into another person’s heart with perfect clarity strikes me as a fool’s game. I don’t care how well we think we should understand them, or how much we love them. All it can do is cause us pain. Examining your own heart, however, is another matter. I think it’s possible to see what’s in there if you work hard enough at it. So in the end maybe that’s the challenge: to look inside your own heart as perceptively and seriously as you can, and to make peace with what you find there. If we hope to truly see another person, we have to start by looking within ourselves.”"
"August 19, 2023 23:52",Drive My Car,16.9%,#FFE0EC,"But, Mr. Kafuku, can any of us ever perfectly understand another person? However much we may love them?”"
"August 19, 2023 23:51",Drive My Car,16.9%,#FFB,Kafuku picked up his glass and swirled the chunk of ice in it. “I worried that I might lose her. Just imagining that made my heart ache.”
"August 19, 2023 23:48",Drive My Car,16.9%,#FFB,I guess I was happy then. But that much happiness can lead to an equal amount of pain.”
"August 19, 2023 23:44",Drive My Car,16.1%,#FFB,"In Kafuku’s considered opinion, there were two types of drinkers: those who drank to enhance their personalities, and those who sought to rid themselves of something. Takatsuki clearly belonged to the latter group."
"August 19, 2023 23:44",Drive My Car,16.1%,#FFB,"Kafuku acted as though he had only the warmest feelings for Takatsuki. This was not a hard thing to do. He was a born listener, and he did truly like the younger man. In addition, the two of them had one big thing in common: both were still in love with the same beautiful, dead woman. Despite the differences in their relationships with her, neither man had been able to get over that loss. They had a lot to talk about"
"August 19, 2023 22:16",Drive My Car,13.7%,#FFB,Whether you want to or not. But the place you return to is always slightly different from the place you left. That’s the rule. It can never be exactly the same.”
"August 19, 2023 21:56",Drive My Car,10.5%,#FFB,"Yet he continued to return to his core principle: that, in every situation, knowledge was better than ignorance. However agonizing, it was necessary to confront the facts. Only through knowing could a person become strong."
"August 19, 2023 21:56",Drive My Car,10.5%,#FFE0EC,"The most excruciating thing, though, had been maintaining a normal life knowing his partner’s secret—the effort it required to keep her in the dark. Smiling calmly when his heart was torn and his insides were bleeding. Behaving as if everything was fine while the two of them took care of the daily chores, chatted, made love at night. This was not something that a normal person could pull off. But Kafuku was a professional actor. Shedding his self, his flesh and blood, in order to inhabit a role was his calling. And he embraced this one with all his might. A role performed without an audience"
